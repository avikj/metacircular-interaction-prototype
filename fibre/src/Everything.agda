-- The law's other projection: the residual, and the price of a collapse.
open import Fibre.Residue_TheResidualIsTheOtherProjectionOfTheSameGraph

-- The repair: the diagnosis is a CENSUS, not a verdict.  A fibre fails to
-- be contractible in two opposite ways — empty (नास्ति: no source over b,
-- धनात्मकम्) and crowded (नष्टि, अप्रतिकार्या) — and `isContr` merges
-- them.  Contains the computed refutation of the sequential diagnostic.
open import Fibre.WholePartialDesa_TheFibreCensusIsATermAndItRefutesTheSequentialDiagnostic

-- The census's seam, closed: the fibre of the truncation map is the whole
-- source, so the level-४ criterion is a theorem and not a conjecture.
open import Fibre.Avaccheda_TheTruncationsFibreIsTheWholeSourceSoTheSeamConjectureIsATheorem

-- …and the census's own collapse, one level up.  A fourth outcome exists
-- that `देश` structurally cannot express — the question with no subject —
-- and `interactive/Obstruction.hs` has carried it in a type all along while
-- the Agda lane has never had it.  Silence is not denial.

-- two — three theorems say so — and carried = the pair of magnitudes.
open import Fibre.KuttakaValli_TheSideIsAFreeSlotAndThatIsWhatMakesTheStepDecisionFree

-- वर्गप्रकृति (Brahmagupta, Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta 18, 628 CE; the चक्रवाल
-- of Jayadeva c. 950 and Bhskara II, Bjagaita, 1150): base = the two

-- with 1.1.60, 1.1.62, 1.3.9, 1.1.5): a वर्ण's three fields are mutually
-- independent — three theorems say so — so the base is (वर्ण , the form
-- substituted) and the carried datum is (स्थानी , सञ्ज्ञा) of the output,
-- both functions of the base.  The अल्/अनल् exception of 1.1.56 is the

-- जीविता-स्मृति — the carried memory is alive at every depth of the infinite

-- पुनरागमन read forward into infinity — losslessness as उपयोग at every rung.
open import Fibre.JivitaSmrti

-- The naming of the law: Carrier IS the motive (the universal lossless
-- middle), each projection of §Sesa's graph is a realization, and every
-- map factors as realize ∘ to-motive (middle-out).  Adds the mediation:
-- two realizations of one motive-source translate through the shared
-- middle rather than by a direct compiler.
open import Fibre.TheCarrierIsTheMotiveAndEachReadingIsARealization

-- A reading, as a reusable shape: a collapse into a set, with its kept
-- middle (Carrier) and owed residual (शेष) derived at the record level,
-- and the two halves of the law as its derived theorems.  The verdict
-- reading (Bool → Unit) is a checked instance; the six domain readings
-- named in the kernel overview instantiate this shape in their own files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The generalisation: from lossless RE-PRESENTATION to lossless
-- COMPUTATION, and from an unfolding stream to an interaction.
--
-- `Fibre.Carrier` proves that a computation may carry its own image and
-- the witness that it IS that image at no informational cost, because the
-- fibre singl (f a) is contractible.  That is a change of PRESENTATION.
-- The four modules below are the change of COMPUTATION and of STATE, and
-- the boundary between the two is the whole point:
--
--   univalence transports a PROVED EQUIVALENCE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The trace family of a factorisation is FORCED to be the fibre family of
-- the map it induces — so the residue of a computation is not a design
-- choice.  Carrier is the contractible end of that same scale.
open import Fibre.Trace_TheTraceFamilyIsForcedToBeTheFibreAndTheCarrierIsItsContractibleCase

-- A state transition need not be invertible for its residue to be typed.
-- `collapse` (n ↦ 0) is the witness: provably not an equivalence, residue
-- provably ℕ, and lossless all the same.  `suc` is the opposite failure —
-- an EMPTY fibre — which isContr alone cannot distinguish from the first.
open import Fibre.LawfulStep_TheVisibleStepNeedNotBeInvertibleAndItsResidueIsStillExactlyOneFibre

-- Commutation is the certificate that a serialisation was removable: any
-- interleaving of two commuting steps reduces to the two counts.  When it
-- fails, it fails computably, and the order stays in the answer.
open import Fibre.Order_CommutationIsTheProofThatTheOrderWasNeverThereAndItsFailureIsRetained

-- The orbit is the one-query case of the interactive coalgebra: under the

open import Fibre.Interaction_TheOrbitIsTheOneQueryCaseOfTheInteractiveCoalgebraAndTheDemandIsWhatDiffers

-- The formal corpus itself is the same coalgebra: a state is Σ A . A and a
