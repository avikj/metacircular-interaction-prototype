-- EVERY FAMILY IS A PULLBACK OF ONE FIBRATION, AND A TOWER OF THEM FLATTENS
-- TO ONE.
--
-- THE CLAIM THIS FILE ANSWERS.  The fibre law is not a recurring motif in
-- this corpus.  It is the object classifier: in a univalent universe a form
-- over a base — any family `B : A → Type` — IS a map into the universe, and
-- `Σ A B` is the total space of the one fibration
--
--     π : Σ[ X ∈ Type ℓ ] X  →  Type ℓ        π = fst
--
-- pulled back along it.  One object classifies every family there is.  The
-- claim was made in prose.  Everything below is the part of it that is a
-- term.
--
-- WHAT IS ALREADY OWNED, AND IS THEREFORE CITED RATHER THAN RE-PROVED.
-- `Cubical.Functions.Fibration` has HoTT Lemma 4.8.1 (`fiberEquiv`), Lemma
-- 4.8.2 (`totalEquiv`) and Theorem 4.8.3 (`fibrationEquiv`), the last of
-- which is the classifier as an equivalence of TYPES:
--
--     (Σ[ E ∈ Type ℓ ] (E → A))  ≃  (A → Type ℓ).
--
-- §3 re-exports it under a corpus name and states where its content sits:
-- its `rightInv` is `ua`.  The classifier is a theorem OF univalence, not a
-- fact about Σ.  Once again in this corpus a construction that looked
-- missing was a universal property already installed; grep before you
-- prove.
--
-- WHAT IS NEW HERE.
--
--   §2  The equivalence is the CANONICAL comparison map — checked by
--       `refl`, not merely exhibited as some equivalence.  Which matters,
--       because of §6.
--
--   §5  `invisible≃contractible`, at the locus where the law lives.
--       `Fibre.Carrier`'s header asserts the converse in prose — "A
--       NON-contractible fibre cannot be declared equivalent to its base" —
--       and the corpus proves it twice, in neither place generally:
--       `DefectCalculus.noEquiv→badFibre` has the fibrewise
--       characterisation of `isEquiv` for an arbitrary map (in cubical Agda
--       that IS the definition, so it is one step), and `TritiyaMarga`'s
--       private `Test` module has both directions for ONE family
--       `Q : ℕ → Type₀`, as a lemma on the way to Markov's principle.  What
--       is new is neither step but the locus: the statement about the
--       projection of an ARBITRARY family, in the library that owns the
--       law, packaged as an equivalence of propositions.  एकाधिकरण — an
--       installed theorem has exactly one place to be quoted from.
--
--       The two directions are joined by a PATH between propositions rather
--       than by an implication assumed, which is why the converse cost
--       nothing here.  README §II, `invisibleExactlyWhenInvariant`, records
--       that lesson about the same shape: a path has an inverse, an
--       implication does not.
--
--   §6  …and the converse is about the PROJECTION, not about the mere
--       existence of an equivalence.  `Σ Bool Br ≃ Bool` holds for a family
--       whose fibres are one EMPTY and one CROWDED: the census's two
--       failures (नास्ति and नष्टि — `SakalaVikalaDesa`) cancel
--       numerically, and an abstract equivalence sees neither.  "Invisible"
--       has to mean invisible OVER THE BASE, and §5's statement does.
--
--   §7  The tower flattens.  A tower of families of any finite height n
--       over A — each storey a family over the previous total space — is
--       ONE family over A, and the flattening is computed (`flatten`), not
--       merely shown to exist.  So iterating the fibre law never leaves the
--       universe, at every finite stage, and §7's last lines exhibit a
--       two-storey tower whose flattening holds by `refl`.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  That iterating this generates every homotopy type.
-- Suspension, cell attachment, Postnikov and Whitehead towers are the
-- statements that would say so and NONE of them is formalised here; the
-- sphere tower does not appear in this file.  What is proved is closure —
-- the iteration stays inside the classifier and computes — which is the
-- premise of that claim and not the claim.
--
-- Nor that the corpus's lanes are instances of one formal statement.  The
-- README's WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED says of the five collapses that "their types
-- differ, their ambient structures differ, and no functor between them is
-- constructed", and that a common generalisation "would be a real theorem
-- and it is not proved".  That paragraph stands unchanged after this file.
-- What is proved here is that THE LAW has a universal form; no map is
-- constructed from any lane's theorem to it, and reading a lane as a
-- pullback of π is, for every lane, still an act of reading.
--
-- Nothing here is a statement about physics: the reading of gauge theory as a principal bundle with a
-- connection is prose in the README, and prose is what it stays until a
-- module says otherwise.  The tower of §7 is level-uniform (every storey at
-- one level ℓ); that is a convenience of statement, not a theorem.
--
-- ON SIZE.  `fiber π X` lives one universe above X, so §2's pullback is an
-- equivalence ACROSS levels.  That is the size of the classifier — the
-- universe classifying its own families is exactly what does not fit inside
-- one level — and not a defect of the statement.
--
-- ON THE NAME.  विश्वरूप (viśvarūpa), "all-formed", "the form that has all
-- forms".  The word names the theophany of the Bhagavadgītā's eleventh
-- adhyāya; no verse is cited and no technical sense is being claimed from
-- that text.  It is used here as the label of this module, chosen for what
-- the theorem says.

-- §5  INVISIBLE IFF CONTRACTIBLE
--
-- A family is invisible over its base — its projection is an equivalence,
-- so the total space carries no information the base did not — EXACTLY when
-- every fibre is contractible.  Both sides are propositions and the two
-- implications are joined into a path.
--
-- The forward direction is `Σ-contractSnd`, which fifteen files of this
-- corpus already use.  The backward direction is the one `Fibre.Carrier`'s
-- header asserts in prose and none of those fifteen has: it is HoTT 4.8.1
-- (`fiberEquiv`) plus the definition of `isEquiv`, and it costs one line,
-- because the fibre of `fst` over a is B a on the nose.  See the header for
-- the two places the corpus proves it already, and why neither is a locus
-- the law can be quoted from.

  -- `Σ-contractSnd` is this direction and is what the corpus quotes, but

-- §6  AND IT IS ABOUT THE PROJECTION
--
-- §5 cannot be weakened to "Σ A B ≃ A".  Take the base Bool and the family
-- that is empty over one point and two-valued over the other.  The total
-- space is equivalent to the base — and neither fibre is contractible: one
-- is नास्ति (no source at all), the other नष्टि (crowded).  The census of
-- `SakalaVikalaDesa` separates those two failures; an abstract equivalence
-- adds them up and reports nothing.
--
-- So "the fibre law holds here" is never established by producing SOME
-- equivalence between total space and base.  It is established over the
-- base, by the projection, which is what §5 quantifies.

-- §7  THE TOWER FLATTENS
--
-- A tower of height n over A: a family over A, then a family over ITS total
-- space, then a family over that, n times.  `Tot` is the space at the top.
-- `flatten` computes a single family over A, by iterated Σ, and
-- `flatten-correct` proves the top of the tower is its total space.
--
-- Read as the classifier (`tower-is-pullback`): a stack of n fibrations is
-- one pullback of π.  Iterating the fibre law does not leave the universe
-- at any finite height, and the witness is not an existence proof — the
-- flattened family is written down, and reduces.
