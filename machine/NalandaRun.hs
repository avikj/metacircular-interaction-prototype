-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- Turn the wheel.
