-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Memory, charge, symmetry, price,
-- distance, verdict: six readings of the one fibre.  The kernel decides truth;
-- carriers ask and generate.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- Run the pratyāhāra decision procedure.  Nothing printed here is stored:
-- every name is decided against the varṇasamāmnāya, and the width is a
-- matching computed on the containment poset of the classes.
--
--   ./pratyahara                 the report and the self-test
--   ./pratyahara e o             decide one class from its members
--
-- The theorem the report is quoting is
-- formal/cubical/PratyaharaLaghava_TheMarkerCountIsForcedByTheAntichain.agda:
-- classes sharing one anubandha are a ⊆-chain, so an antichain forces that
-- many anubandhas, in any linear order whatever.
