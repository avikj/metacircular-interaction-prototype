-- Certificate.hs — the Agda emitter for the kernel gate.
--
-- LEGACY POINTER (2026-08-23).  MathMachine.hs — "the CLOSE-lane
-- ℕ-equation spinner", 239 rounds / ZERO theorems installed — was RETIRED
-- at commit 832a549 as a toy that "looks alive but isn't".  Certificate.hs
-- is one of the four organs the commit records as SURVIVING it (with
-- Certify.hs, ArithVocab.hs, library.terms); the live substrate is the
-- cubical corpus + the crystal runtime, and candidate generation is now
-- the endogenous frontier (Sanghatta critical pairs, Obstruction's kernel
-- refusal stream). The MathMachine references below are the historical
-- record of what this emitter was built against; read them past tense.
--
-- WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY (retained as the emitter's design record)
--
-- MathMachine.hs [RETIRED, 832a549] proved equations with its own
-- rewriting + structural induction, then submitted each one to
-- `kernelAccept`, which emits a candidate Agda module and typechecks it.
-- The emitter it used (`agdaCertificate`, MathMachine.hs ~1193) was
--
--     candidate : (x y z u v w : ℕ) → LHS ≡ RHS
--     candidate x y z u v w = refl
--
-- Three separate faults make that gate reject everything.  All three were
-- reproduced directly (see the notes on each below); this module fixes all
-- three.
--
--   (1) LIBRARY RESOLUTION.  The engine runs
--
--           agda -i formal/cubical -i <tmpdir> <tmpdir>/Candidate.agda
--
--       from the repository root.  `formal/cubical` is NOT the cubical
--       library — it is the NaturalMachine lane, and it carries
--       `natural-machine.agda-lib` (`depend: cubical`).  The cubical
--       library itself lives at /tmp/cubical and is reachable only through
--       ~/.agda/libraries.  Agda finds a library only by walking up from
--       the *checked file* to an .agda-lib; a module in a temp directory
--       has none, so `Cubical.Foundations.Prelude` is unresolvable and the
--       candidate dies at scope-checking, before any proof term is looked
--       at.  Reproduced with the engine's own positive control:
--
--           $ LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 ./math-machine --kernel-self-test
--             KERNEL-REJECT round=0 (0+x) = x  ... Failed to find source
--             of module Cubical.Fou...
--
--       i.e. the gate rejects `0 + x ≡ x`.  Zero KERNEL-ACCEPTs was never
--       a statement about the emitter's expressiveness; nothing could pass.
--       Fixed here by `kAgdaLibrary` / `agdaArgs`, which add
--       `--library=cubical` to the otherwise identical invocation.
--
--   (2) FILE ENCODING.  `kernelAccept` writes the candidate with plain
--       `writeFile`, which uses the locale encoding.  Without a UTF-8
--       locale in the machine's own environment this throws before agda is
--       ever spawned:
--
--           mm: /tmp/math-machine-agda.pXe4qi/Candidate.agda: withFile:
--               invalid argument (cannot encode character '\8469')
--
--       Fixed here by `writeUtf8`, which sets the handle encoding
--       explicitly rather than trusting the ambient locale, and by
--       forcing LC_ALL in the agda child's environment.
--
--   (3) EXPRESSIVENESS, the fault the seam was actually designed around.
--       `agdaTerm` knew only 0, s, + and · — four of the eight symbols in
--       `vocabulary` — and the only proof shape was `refl`, so nothing
--       needing induction could be certified.  Both are addressed below.
--
-- FAITHFULNESS (the load-bearing point)
--
-- A certificate about a different function is worse than no certificate.
-- Each symbol below is either an Agda function that is clause-for-clause
-- the same recursion as the corresponding `symDefs` in MathMachine's
-- `vocabulary`, or a local definition transcribed from those `symDefs`:
--
--   0, s     zero, suc                                     (identical)
--   +        Agda.Builtin.Nat._+_  via Cubical.Data.Nat     (see note A)
--   *        Agda.Builtin.Nat._*_  via Cubical.Data.Nat     (see note A)
--   -        Agda.Builtin.Nat._-_ = _∸_ via Cubical.Data.Nat
--            machine: -x0=x, -0x=0, -(sx)(sy)=-xy
--            builtin:  n-zero=n, zero-suc m=zero, suc n-suc m=n-m
--            — same clauses, same order.  Exact match.
--   max      LOCAL.  Cubical's `max` (Cubical.Data.Nat.Properties) is the
--            same function but splits on the FIRST argument, whereas
--            MathMachine's symDefs are (max x 0 = x), (max 0 x = x),
--            (max (s x) (s y) = s (max x y)) — first clause on the second
--            argument.  Emitted locally in the machine's clause order so
--            the machine's own reductions are available (see note B).
--   le       LOCAL.  Cubical has no ℕ-valued ≤ test.  Transcribed from
--            symDefs: le 0 x = s 0, le (s x) 0 = 0, le (s x) (s y) = le x y.
--            Agrees with `symSem` (\vs -> if a <= b then 1 else 0).
--   gcd      Cubical.Data.Nat.GCD.gcd.  Same function as Haskell `gcd` on
--            ℕ (both are the ≡-unique greatest common divisor, gcd 0 0 = 0),
--            but it is defined through `euclid` and reduces on no open
--            term, so gcd equations will essentially never certify.  It is
--            translated anyway: a KERNEL-REJECT carrying agda's message is
--            more informative than a KERNEL-SKIP.
--
-- Note A.  Agda's `+` and `·` recurse on the FIRST argument; MathMachine's
-- symDefs recurse on the second (x+0=x, x+s y = s(x+y)).  These are the
-- same function on ℕ — the machine's `symSem` is Haskell's (+) and (*),
-- and the cubical/builtin operations are ordinary ℕ addition and
-- multiplication — so the certificate is about the right object.  The
-- clause order differs only in which equations hold *definitionally*, and
-- the first-argument order was measured to certify strictly more of the
-- machine's library than a transcription of the symDefs would (it makes
-- (s x + y) = s (x + y) and (s x · y) = y + x · y refl, which the
-- second-argument order does not).
--
-- Note B.  No Agda case tree reproduces MathMachine's `max` reductions
-- exactly: the machine uses (max x 0 = x) and (max 0 x = x) as
-- unconditional rewrite rules in BOTH argument positions, while a case
-- tree must commit to splitting one column first.  The local definition
-- here matches the symDefs clause list literally; what it cannot match is
-- the machine's rewriting being stronger than pattern matching.  This is a
-- real residual gap and it is why `(x max s 0) = (s 0 max x)` does not
-- certify (see `main`'s report).
--
-- INVOCATION BUDGET
--
-- Trying several proof shapes means calling agda more than once per
-- candidate.  That is bounded and explicit: `kMaxAgdaCalls`.  The order is
-- always cheapest-first — a plain `refl` module (one call), then the
-- induction skeleton with step shapes from `stepShapes`.  If the *base*
-- clause is what agda rejects, the remaining step shapes cannot help, so
-- the search stops there (`baseClauseFailed`); a false equation therefore
-- costs 2 calls, not `kMaxAgdaCalls`.
--
-- A candidate whose proof note names NO induction variable used to cost 1
-- call and be rejected, always — the emitter emitted no induction module for
-- it at all.  That is the traffic the engine's residual seam carries, since a
-- subgoal harvested from the kernel's own stall arrives unannotated.  Such a
-- candidate now gets the same shape menu once per variable, bounded by
-- `kMaxAgdaCallsUnannotated`, and the annotated case is unchanged in reach,
-- in shape and in budget.  Measured on `machine/library.snapshot.txt` with
-- every note stripped — which is exactly the shape a residual arrives in —
-- by `machine/SesaPariksa_WhichOfTheSixOutstandingDemandsInductionReaches.hs`
-- on 2026-08-20:
--
--     note-less, before:  5/28 certified, 28 agda calls   (derived, exactly:
--                         only the `refl` lines could close)
--     note-less, after : 15/28 certified, 144 agda calls  (measured)
--     annotated, after : 15/28 certified, 123 agda calls  (measured,
--                        byte-identical to the run before the change)
--
-- So the annotation is no longer load-bearing for REACH; it is worth 21 agda
-- calls over the snapshot, and the whole of the difference is search the note
-- would have skipped.
--
-- THE CERTIFICATE CACHE (added 2026-08-16)
--
-- The gate's wall clock is one agda process per emitted module, ~1-3 s
-- each, almost all of it re-loading library interfaces.  The engine
-- re-derives and re-submits the same equations across rounds and across
-- runs, so it re-pays that cost for modules it has already checked.  The
-- cache below removes exactly that repetition and nothing else.
--
-- WHAT IS KEYED.  The unit is ONE EMITTED MODULE, not one conclusion.  The
-- module source is the complete input to agda — it already encodes the
-- conclusion, the concept definitions, the vocabulary transcriptions
-- (`localMax`, `localLe`), the imports, and the proof skeleton — so hashing
-- it is hashing everything the verdict depends on inside this process.
-- Keying per module rather than per conclusion also means the search in
-- `certifyWith` reuses its own intermediate failures: a rejected shape that
-- cost a call last time costs none this time.
--
-- The key is a 128-bit FNV-1a hash of the UTF-8 bytes of
-- `toolchain ++ "\0" ++ source`, where `toolchain` is the output of
-- `agda --version` together with `kAgdaLibrary` and `kIncludeRoot`.  The
-- toolchain is in the key because a verdict is a fact about a source AND a
-- checker: upgrading agda must miss, not falsely hit.  What is still NOT in
-- the key is the content of the cubical library itself and of
-- `formal/cubical/`; editing those can in principle change a verdict
-- without changing the key.  That is a real residual and it is why
-- `MATH_CERTCACHE=0` exists (it bypasses the cache entirely, for a clean
-- re-measurement or after a library edit).
--
-- THE HASH IS ONLY AN INDEX.  Every entry stores the full source it was
-- built from, and `lookupCache` compares that stored source to the
-- requested source byte for byte before returning a verdict.  A hash
-- collision therefore produces a MISS, never a wrong answer; the hash's job
-- is to name a file, not to stand in for the content.
--
-- WHAT IS STORED.  `machine/.certcache/<key>`, one small UTF-8 file:
-- the verdict word, agda's exit code, the toolchain string, agda's output
-- verbatim, and the module source.  A reader can copy the SOURCE block into
-- a file and re-run agda on it; that is the point of storing it.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT STORED.
--
--   * `Untranslatable` is never cached.  It is a property of the emitter --
--     `agdaTermWith` returned Nothing -- and no agda process is involved,
--     so there is nothing to memoise and caching it would freeze an
--     emitter limitation into a file that outlives the emitter.
--
--   * A REJECTION IS CACHED ONLY WHEN IT IS A GENUINE TYPE ERROR
--     (`cacheableFailure`).  This is the decision requirement (e) asks for,
--     and the reasoning is: exit 0 can only mean "agda typechecked this
--     module", so success is always cacheable; a non-zero exit means
--     nothing on its own, because a missing library, a locale fault, an
--     absent `formal/cubical`, or a killed process all produce one.
--     Caching those would turn a transient environment fault into a
--     permanent verdict — the failure mode this whole file was written to
--     fix (see fault (1) above: a path error was recorded as a
--     KERNEL-REJECT indistinguishable from a false statement).  So a
--     failure is cached only if agda located the error inside
--     Candidate.agda AND the message carries a type-error signature AND no
--     environment-failure marker appears.  Everything else is re-run.
--
-- HOW A HIT IS REPORTED.  A cached run spends 0 agda calls, and that 0 is
-- what the `Verdict` carries; the shape string is prefixed `cached, ` (and
-- a cached rejection's message `cached: `) so no log line and no
-- measurement can read a cache hit as fresh kernel work.  If a search mixes
-- hits and fresh calls the count is the number of FRESH calls, and the
-- label is not marked cached — the run did do kernel work.
--
-- IDENTIFIER VALIDATION (added 2026-08-16)
--
-- `defName` was the one candidate-supplied string that reached the emitted
-- module verbatim, in three positions.  It is now checked against
-- [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]* at each of them, and a candidate carrying an
-- ill-formed name produces NO MODULE (`Untranslatable`, 0 agda calls) rather
-- than an emitted module that agda then declines.  See `validAgdaIdent` for
-- what was reproducible before the check, including the case that made three
-- different right-hand sides certify against one left-hand side.
--
-- This module deliberately has no dependency on MathMachine: it carries
-- its own copy of the Term type so it can be compiled, run and tested on
-- its own.  `main` is that test.  From the repository root:
--
--     ghc -O0 -Wall -main-is Certificate.main \
--         -outputdir /tmp/cert-build -o /tmp/cert machine/Certificate.hs
--     /tmp/cert            # or: /tmp/cert <repository-root>
--
-- It takes about 100 seconds and prints one line per equation.  Result at
-- the time of writing: 15 of the 28 lines of machine/library.snapshot.txt
-- certify, 13 are rejected with agda's reason, none are untranslatable,
-- and four deliberate falsehoods are all rejected.  Every one of the 13
-- rejections is a commutativity- or associativity-shaped statement whose
-- BASE case is itself a lemma (y ≢ y + zero definitionally); closing them
-- needs a lemma environment — certificates emitted in dependency order,
-- with earlier theorems in scope for later ones — not more step shapes.

--
-- THE HOLE THIS CLOSES (notes/TRUTH_GATE_AUDIT.md §1, machine/GateAudit.hs
-- §(1), both 2026-08-16).
--
-- `defName` is the ONLY candidate-supplied string that reaches the emitted
-- module, and until this predicate existed it reached it VERBATIM in three
-- positions: the definition's signature line and its clause line (`emit` in
-- `preambleWith`), and every occurrence of the concept inside the equation's
-- own type (`prefixAgda`, via the `lookupDef` fallback in `render`).  A name
-- is not a token to the emitter, it is a string, so a name may contain
-- anything — including newlines.  Two consequences were reproduced against
-- this very file:
--
--   * a name containing "\n{-# OPTIONS --no-safe #-}\npostulate evil : …"
--     put that pragma and that postulate into `Candidate.agda` verbatim
--     (harmless in the end: the injection lands after the module header, so
--     the pragma is ignored, `--safe` stays locked at line 1, and the
--     postulate is refused — verdict `Rejected`); and
--
--   * `injName = "suc x) ≡ (suc x) -- "` is worse and is NOT harmless: it
--     closes the emitter's own parenthesis and comments out the rest of the
--     line, so the module agda checks is `candidate : (x : ℕ) → (suc x) ≡
--     (suc x)`, whatever right-hand side was submitted.  GateAudit obtained
--     `Certified "refl" 1` for three DIFFERENT right-hand sides over one
--     left-hand side (GateAudit.hs:100–109).  That is a soundness break, not
--     a defense-in-depth gap.
--
-- Neither was reachable from the engine, because `inventConcept`
-- (MathMachine.hs:1547) names concepts `"c" ++ show n`.  That is safety by
-- CALLER CONVENTION: the gate did no validation and the convention is not
-- stated in any type.  It is now enforced here, at the emission site, and
-- the enforcement FAILS CLOSED — an offending name yields no module at all
-- (`Nothing` → `Untranslatable`), never an emitted module that agda is asked
-- to have an opinion about.  A candidate the emitter cannot render honestly
-- is a rejected candidate.
--
-- The grammar is the audit's: [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*, ASCII by construction
-- and not via `isAlpha`/`isAlphaNum`, whose Unicode generality would readmit
-- characters Agda's lexer treats specially.  Every character of a legal name

-- cannot close a parenthesis, open a comment, start a pragma, or reach the

-- THE OPTIONS LINE, WRITTEN ONCE.
--
-- It was written twice — here and in `canaryModule` — and the two copies
-- drifted: the candidate modules carried `--guardedness`, the controls did
-- not.  That is not a cosmetic difference.  Agda's `[InfectiveImport]` rule
-- makes `--guardedness` propagate through imports, so under a cubical library
-- compiled with it (Agda 2.8.0 + the Homebrew cubical build, measured
-- 2026-08-20) a module that opens `Cubical.Foundations.Prelude` WITHOUT
-- `--guardedness` fails at scope-checking, before any proof term is looked at:
--
--     error: [InfectiveImport]
--     Importing module Cubical.Foundations.Prelude using the
--     --guardedness flag from a module which does not.
--
-- `canaryTrue` therefore failed for a reason that has nothing to do with the
-- kernel's ability to check proofs, `kernelIsChecking` returned False, and
-- `vetSuccess` downgraded EVERY acceptance to an environment fault.  Measured
-- reach on that container: 0/28, where the same binary with the pragmas
-- agreeing gets 15/28.  The refusal was correct and the reason given for it
-- was invented, which is not.
--
-- Sharing the string is the mechanism.  A control module that is not compiled
-- the way the candidate modules are compiled is not a control for them, and
-- the only way to keep that true under future edits is for there to be one

-- ------------------------------------------------------- the two controls
--
-- WHAT AN EXIT STATUS IS WORTH.  Until 2026-08-16 the gate's entire evidence
-- that a candidate had been PROVED was `code == ExitSuccess`.  That is not
-- evidence about mathematics, it is evidence about a number a process
-- returned, and `machine/GateAudit.hs` section C exhibited three ways to
-- separate the two.  The cheapest is not exotic: a wrapper of the shape
--
--     agda "$@" 2>&1 | cat
--
-- has the exit status of `cat`.  Real agda runs, really reports `suc x != x`,
-- really exits 1 -- and the gate read 0 and returned `Certified "refl" 1`
-- for `s(x) = x`.  Anyone who has ever piped a compiler through `tee` to
-- keep its output has built this shim by accident.
--
-- The repair is the discipline this repository already applies to its
-- finite verifications: a positive control is not evidence without a
-- FALSIFIER.  `ArithVocab`'s lifting-the-exponent law is trusted because
-- the same harness that accepts 53,760 true triples is watched rejecting a
-- false one at (p=2,a=3,n=2).  The kernel gets the same treatment.  Two
-- modules, run once per process, uncached, through the same `runAgda` the
-- candidates use:
--
--   * `canaryTrue` MUST check.  It fails when agda is missing, the library
--     is unregistered, the include root has moved -- the 2026-08-15 fault,
--     where every candidate became a KERNEL-REJECT.
--   * `canaryFalse` MUST NOT.  It is `suc x ≡ x` closed by `refl`.  A
--     checker that accepts it is not checking, and NOTHING it says can be
--     read as a proof.
--
-- One of the two catches every attack in section C, because each of them
-- has to make a false module pass in order to make a false candidate pass.
-- The cost is two agda processes per engine run, paid on the first success
-- and never again; a run that certifies nothing never pays it at all.
--
-- The controls are run UNCACHED on purpose.  A canary served from an
-- unauthenticated on-disk store would be a canary an attacker can answer.

-- WHY THIS IS FOUR VALUES AND NOT A BOOLEAN.
--
-- The two controls fail for opposite reasons and the old code folded them
-- into one `Bool`, so `vetSuccess` printed ONE sentence for BOTH:
--
--     the kernel accepted `suc x ≡ x` by refl.  It is not checking proofs
--
-- On 2026-08-20 that sentence was printed 33 times by a container in which
-- the kernel had rejected `suc x ≡ x` exactly as it should, and in which the
-- POSITIVE control was the thing that failed — for an `[InfectiveImport]`
-- scope error (see `kOptionsPragma`).  The verdict was right and the reason
-- was invented, and a reader who believed the reason would have gone looking
-- for a broken agda instead of a drifted pragma.  Two distinct observations
-- reported under one name is the collapse this repository's own contract
-- forbids: a written defect must state WHICH.
--
-- Fail-closed is unchanged.  Only `KernelChecking` licenses an acceptance;
-- the other three are refusals.  What changes is that the refusal now names
-- the control that actually failed and carries agda's own words for it.
--
-- The fourth constructor exists for the same reason as the split: a negative
-- control that merely EXITED NONZERO has not been watched rejecting anything,
-- and reporting that as "accepted a falsehood" would repeat the invented
-- reason one level down.  Not-observed and observed-false stay apart.

-- An entry agda then contradicts is DELETED, because it is either poisoned
-- or was written by a toolchain that lied.

-- are verdicts, and no acceptance of either kind is honoured by a process

-- This function accepted only the comma, so under 2.8 it returned `Nothing`

--
--   1. `certifyWith`'s base-clause early exit (`blamedLine out == Just

--      problem still paid all eleven remaining step shapes.  That is the
--      whole of the observed "worst-case 12 (bound 12)": not a hard search,
--      a dead comparison.
--   2. `cacheableFailure` requires `isJust (blamedLine out)`, so NO rejection
--      was cacheable and every run re-paid for every rejection.
--   3. `kernelStatus`'s negative control, which reuses `cacheableFailure`,
--      could not recognise `suc x != x` as a located type error — so the
--      falsifier fired, correctly, and was not credited with firing.
--
-- The separator is required to be one of `,.` AND to be followed by a digit,
-- so `Prelude.agda:` (no line) and prose containing a colon still yield
-- `Nothing` rather than a fabricated line number.  Fabricating one is worse
-- than declining: it would make the base-clause exit fire on the wrong

-- --------------------------------------------- serialisable certificates
--
-- The corpus wants machine/library.txt to be a re-checkable LEDGER, not a
-- trust-me list.  `certify` above proves a library equation once, inside
-- this process, and then the proof term is gone: the file records only the
-- equation and a prose note ("[induction on x]").  Re-reading the file
-- therefore re-runs the *search* (agdaCertificate + stepShapes), which is
-- not the same as re-checking a fixed proof — a change to `stepShapes` could
-- silently change which library entries are provable.
--
-- A `SerialCert` closes that gap.  It records the exact proof WITNESS that
-- agda accepted (refl, or induction on a named variable with the exact step
-- term), so:
--
--   (a) it RECONSTRUCTS THE PROOF TERM deterministically — `reconstructModule`
--       emits the one Agda module that carries the accepted proof, with no
--       search; and
--   (b) it ROUND-TRIPS — `serializeCert` / `parseSerialCert` are inverses on
--       the fragment, so a serialised ledger entry parses back to the same
--       witness, whose reconstructed module agda re-checks to the same
--       theorem (`replayCert`).
--
-- The Agda side these land in is NaturalMachine.RewriteCertificate: a checked
-- `candidate : lhs ≡ rhs` is exactly the hypothesis of `derivation-sound` /
-- `induction-sound` there, i.e. the semantic warrant that the endpoints
-- denote pointwise-equal functions ℕ → ℕ.

-- The proof that a `SerialCert` carries, in a form that reconstructs a

-- (MathMachine.hs ~465): variables are x y z u v w / nⁱ, `0` and other
-- nullary symbols are bare, `+ * ^ gcd max` are infix `(a op b)`, and every
-- other symbol (`s`, `-`, `le`, invented concepts `c0`…) is prefix
-- `f(a,b,…)`.  This parser is the exact inverse of that `show`, so a line the
-- machine wrote parses back to the term it denotes.

-- Operators the machine renders infix (Show instance's list).  Order does
-- not matter here: their first characters are disjoint.

--
-- THE WORD-OPERATOR AMBIGUITY, AND WHY THE GREEDY SCAN WAS WRONG (2026-08-20).
--
-- MathMachine's `Show` renders `max` and `gcd` INFIX AND WITHOUT SPACES, so
-- `x max x` is written `(xmaxx)` and `s(0) max x` is written `(s(0)maxx)`.
-- A scan that takes the longest run of identifier characters swallows the
-- operator: it read `xmaxx` as one nullary symbol, then looked for an infix
-- operator, found `)`, and returned `Nothing`.  `parseLibraryLine` therefore
-- failed on EVERY `max` line the machine has ever written — four of the 28
-- lines of `machine/library.snapshot.txt` — and failed by returning "this
-- line did not parse", which reads as a malformed file rather than as a
-- defect in the reader.  `Certificate.main` never saw it because its
-- `snapshot` is transcribed by hand in Haskell; anything that reads the FILE
-- (`CertReplay`, and the combined-reach harness) lost those lines silently.
--
-- The repair is to stop the run at any position after the first where one of
-- the word operators begins.  `showInfixOps` is the same list `pShowOp`
-- consults, so the scanner and the operator reader cannot disagree about what
-- an operator is.  Position 0 is exempt, so the PREFIX spellings `gcd(x,0)`
-- and the nullary `max` still read as names; and the guard `not (null taken)`
-- means the stop can never produce an empty name.
--
-- This is a parser repair only.  It changes no verdict about any equation: a
-- line that did not parse produced no candidate at all.
