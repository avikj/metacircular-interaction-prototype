-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Memory, charge, symmetry, price,
-- distance, verdict: six readings of the one fibre.  The kernel decides truth;
-- carriers ask and generate.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- समग्र (samagra), "whole, total, entire" — used here for the total
-- space Σ[ b ∈ B ] शेष f b, the residual gathered back up over every
-- target point at once.  Sanskrit common-noun usage, not cited from a
-- mathematical text; the mathematics is HoTT 4.8 (total space of a
-- fibration ≃ the type it fibrates), specifically the total-space
-- characterization of `Σ-contractSnd`/`fiberEquiv` already in this
-- corpus's substrate (`Cubical.Foundations.Equiv`).
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED OF ANY SOURCE.  Nothing below is Āryabhaṭa's; शेष
-- and its citation are inherited unchanged from
-- `Punaragamana.Sesa_TheResidualIsTheOtherProjectionOfTheSameGraph`.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS.
--
-- `Sesa` proves the graph Γf has two projections: मूल-प्रक्षेप (to A,
-- always an equivalence) and लक्ष्य-प्रक्षेप (to B, an equivalence iff f
-- is).  It gets from `Carrier f ≃ Σ[ b ] शेष f b` (`ग्राह`) and
-- `Carrier f ≃ A` (`मूल-प्रक्षेप-समता`) SEPARATELY.  Nowhere in that
-- module, or anywhere else searched in `punaragamana/src` or
-- `formal/cubical` (grepped for `Σ[ b`  ` शेष` composed against `A ≃`,
-- 2026-08-24: no hit), is the two COMPOSED into the one statement that
-- actually names the total-space theorem without routing through
-- `Carrier` as scaffolding:
--
--     A  ≃  Σ[ b ∈ B ] शेष f b
--
-- i.e. a point of A just IS a target point together with a witness that
-- some source point over it is exactly this one — and the composite
-- equivalence's forward map is definitionally `λ a → f a , (a , refl)`,
-- checked by `refl` below, not merely provable.  This is the sharper
-- reading of the design law's two clauses AT ONE SITE: "every genuinely
-- independent distinction must survive" (an `a : A` determines its own
-- residual-witness pair) and "determined structure may remain
-- syntactically present with its determining path" (the `b` and the
-- `refl`-shaped witness are exactly that determined structure), stated as
-- ONE equivalence rather than as two theorems a reader has to compose by
-- hand.
--
-- `Carrier` therefore is not a third object standing between A and
-- Σ[ b ] शेष f b — it is a REDUNDANT waypoint on a path that closes
-- directly.  `होम-सिद्धि` below proves exactly that: the round-trip
-- through Carrier and the direct one agree, definitionally, at every
-- point.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, agda/cubical v0.5 — the library's declared pin.
-- --cubical --safe, no postulates, no holes.

  -- होम-सिद्धि (homa-siddhi, "accomplishment of the offering [into the
  -- fire]" — used here, uncited, for "what routing through the
  -- intermediate object yields, checked against going there directly").
  --
  -- `descend f a` is the canonical Carrier-valued reading of `a` (§ in
  -- `Carrier`, un-pattern-matched by design so it stays computational).
  -- Pushing it through `ग्राह` — `Sesa`'s graph equivalence, built by
  -- composing `Carrier-as-Σ` with the source/target swap `स्वप्` — lands
  -- on EXACTLY `equivFun समग्र-समता a`, by `refl`: both sides unfold to
  -- the literal pair `f a , (a , refl)`.  So the direct route and the
  -- route through `Carrier` are not merely equal as equivalences of
  -- types (which composition already gives up to a propositional path);
  -- they are the same TERM on this representative, with no path needed
  -- to identify them.  `Carrier` supplies nothing here that `descend`
  -- did not already carry.
