-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Memory, charge, symmetry, price,
-- distance, verdict: six readings of the one fibre.  The kernel decides truth;
-- carriers ask and generate.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- Punarāgamana · Carrier
--
-- THE LAW.
--
--   Every genuinely independent distinction must survive; determined
--   structure may remain explicitly present with its determining path.
--
-- THE SHAPE.  Given f : A → B, a point of Carrier f is a point of A that
-- carries its image along with it, plus the witness that it IS that image:
--
--   base    : A
--   carried : B
--   witness : f base ≡ carried
--
-- Two of those three fields look like new data and are not.  The fibre
--
--   Σ[ b ∈ B ] (f a ≡ b)   =   singl (f a)
--
-- is CONTRACTIBLE: inhabited (it is not empty — (f a , refl) is there), and
-- every inhabitant is joined to that canonical point by a coherent path.  So
-- `carried` and `witness` contribute zero further degrees of freedom, and
--
--   A ≃ Carrier f      and, by univalence,      A ≡ Carrier f.
--
-- Avik's formulation, kept verbatim because it is the whole distinction:
-- carried and witness are "syntactically/proof-relevantly present;
-- informationally determined."
--
-- THE CONVERSE, which is the part that does work.  A NON-contractible fibre
-- cannot be declared equivalent to its base.  Contractibility of the fibre is
-- the hypothesis, not a formality — `fibre-isContr` is what `Σ-law` consumes,
-- and without it `Carrier≃-via-law` does not exist.  The intent is that later
-- number-theoretic constructions literally inhabit this shape rather than be
-- judged to resemble it by prose.
--
-- ON THE NAME.  `punarāgamana` (पुनरागमन), "coming back again / return", is
-- used here as the name of this module family.  It is not being cited from a
-- particular text for a particular technical sense: the compound is chosen
-- here, and no source is claimed for it.
--
-- TWO IMPLEMENTATION FACTS, load-bearing, do not regress them:
--
-- 1. Cubical.Data.Sigma, NOT Cubical.Data.Prod.  Prod's product is a data
--    type with no eta, so nothing reduces until the argument is case-split;
--    Σ has eta, so the commuting square below closes by `refl` for an OPAQUE
--    variable.
--
-- 2. `descend` must NOT pattern match on its argument.  Pattern matching
--    would force a case split where the eta rule already gives reduction.
