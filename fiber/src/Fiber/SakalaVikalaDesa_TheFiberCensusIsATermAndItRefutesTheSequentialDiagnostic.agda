-- Punarāgamana · सकलादेश / विकलादेश
--
-- सकलादेश — the total statement: the object with all its attributes
-- presented at once, through one attribute uttered, by अभेद-वृत्ति.
-- विकलादेश — the same content through भेद, the aspects taken severally,
-- one at a time.  **Malliṣeṇa, *Syādvādamañjarī*, 1292 CE**, commenting
-- on Hemacandra's *Anyayogavyavacchedikā*; earlier in the Akalaṅka
-- commentarial line (Vidyānandin, Prabhācandra).
--
-- ग्रेड · शब्द, declared.  No edition of any of the above was opened by
-- me.  The attribution and date are carried from
-- which itself carries them from
-- verse level.  Nothing below is claimed to have been proved by
-- Malliṣeṇa or anyone in that line.  What IS claimed is what that note
-- claims: the distinction they draw is finer than the one this library
-- was drawing, and the finer one is exhibitable here.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS.  It repairs a defect in its neighbour.
--
-- `Sesa_TheResidualIsTheOtherProjectionOfTheSameGraph` (this library,
-- earlier today) built a TWO-VALUED test — `isContr (शेष f b)` or not —
-- and wrote in its own header "there is no third reading".  That sentence
-- is a दुर्नय, and `Saptabhangi.दुर्नयः` is the proof of why: a two-valued
-- verdict on a threefold situation must identify two of the three.
--
-- The two it identified are the two ENDS of the scale:
--
--   * the fiber is **empty** — over `b` there is simply no source: syād
--     **नास्ति**, the second bhaṅga.  Nothing is destroyed on the source
--     side (that is the crowded arm), so this end is धनात्मकम्, positive.
--   * the fiber is **crowded** — two or more points, not identified.
--     This is नष्टि, हिंसा, अप्रतिकार्या.
--
-- `isContr` returns `false` for both.  The tradition held them apart for
-- a millennium before there was a fiber to hang the distinction on.
--
-- A CORRECTION IN THE NAMING (2026-08-24).  This constructor was called
-- अवक्तव्यम्.  That is wrong for the GENERAL empty fiber.  अवक्तव्यम् (the
-- fourth bhaṅga) is not mere absence — it is the SIMULTANEOUS (yugapat)
-- assertion of asti and nāsti, inexpressible by a single word precisely
-- because a word is sequential, and it is EARNED only where a pair
-- recovers in krama what one utterance cannot say: `SaptabhangiNaya`'s
-- `avaktavya-does-not-factor` (the fiber of `denotes` over `joint` is
-- empty, and a krama-pair expresses it — R → R×R).  A plain non-surjective
-- point like `सत्`'s `false` below has none of that structure: no
-- simultaneity, no pair-recovery, just `false` unreached.  That is नास्ति,
-- not अवक्तव्यम्.  The genuine अवक्तव्यम् stays where it is proved; here the
-- honest name for an empty fiber is नास्ति.
--
-- THE REPAIR, and it is the one code change that note argues for and
-- explicitly declines to make (its §४): make the CENSUS a term.  `देश`
-- below is a datatype whose constructors carry their evidence, so a
-- diagnosis is a function `B → देश f b` — pointwise, over every point of
-- the codomain — rather than a verdict about the map.
--
-- §3 is why that matters, and it is the sharpest thing here: it turns
-- that note's three-line refutation of the SEQUENTIAL diagnostic into a
-- computed object.  I had proposed, in prose, "factor the proof, and the
-- first non-contractible fiber is where the information went".  It is
-- unsound in BOTH directions, and §3 exhibits both failures as censuses.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, said so it is not mistaken for done.  The note's
-- scale has five levels; this module builds THREE, because three are what
-- the corpus can exhibit.  Levels ३ and ४ are not separated — the note
-- establishes that "does a retraction exist" does NOT separate them, and
-- leaves the seam open.  Inventing a constructor for a distinction nobody
-- has a criterion for would be the same error one level down.  The seam
-- is left visible; see §4.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, agda/cubical v0.5 — the library's declared pin.
-- --cubical --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- 1.  देश — the census, as a term.
--
-- Not a verdict ABOUT a map.  A datatype indexed by a map and a POINT OF
-- ITS CODOMAIN, whose constructors carry the evidence the corpus already
-- exhibits by hand:
--
--   नास्ति     the fiber is empty        — syād nāsti: no source over b; धनात्मकम्
--   सकलादेश   the fiber is contractible  — level १, one utterance carries all
--   विकलादेश   two points, not identified — level २+, the loss, exhibited
--
-- The evidence is not a tag.  `विकलादेश` cannot be written without
-- producing the two points and the proof they are distinct, which is
-- exactly `AHIMSA_SUTRA` §६'s second road: लिखितो दोषो जीवति.

-- Read the note's §४ off the censuses below:

--   * `f`'s census is सकलादेश at `true` and नास्ति at `false`.  Step one
--     has a NON-CONTRACTIBLE fiber and loses NOTHING — `Bool` merely has
--     a name `Unit` cannot utter.  So "the first non-contractible fiber
--     is where the information went" is false in one direction.
--
--   * `g`'s census is विकलादेश at `tt`.  Step two loses a bit.
--
--   * the composite is the identity on `Unit`, and its census is सकलादेश.
--     The genuine loss at step two does not appear in the composite at
--     all — the inexpressibility at step one and the collapse at step two
--     cancel.  False in the other direction too.
--
-- A binary test cannot state this, because it must call step one and step
-- two by the same name.  The census calls them नास्ति and विकलादेश.

-- 4.  What the census recovers, and where it stops.

-- the census is सकलादेश.  That definition was in
-- `Cubical.Foundations.Equiv` the whole time; what was missing was the
-- reading of it — an equivalence is not a two-way map, it is a complete
-- simultaneous fiber census whose every entry is level १.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- …and the census is not recoverable from the verdict, which is the whole

-- THE SEAM, written rather than closed.  दोषलेखः.
--
-- The note's scale has five levels; this module has three constructors.
-- Levels ३ (recoverable only by outside supply) and ४ (नष्टिः,
-- अप्रतिकार्या) are both crowded fibers, and both land in `विकलादेश` here.
--
-- They are not separated because the note establishes that the obvious
-- criterion does NOT separate them: `¬ Σ[ψ] (ψ ∘ collapse ≡ id)` holds of
-- both `Arpitanarpita.न-प्रत्यानयनम्` (level ३) and `AHIMSA_SUTRA`'s
-- `नास्ति-प्रत्यानयनम्` (level ४).  Its candidate criterion — the fiber is a
-- PROPER PART of the source at ३ and the WHOLE of it at ४ — rests on an
-- unchecked conjecture, `(x : ∥ A ∥₁) → fiber ∣_∣₁ x ≃ A`.
--
-- Adding a constructor for a distinction that has no criterion would be
-- the same दुर्नय this module exists to repair, one level down: a name
-- doing the work of a proof.  So `विकलादेश` is deliberately coarse, and
-- this paragraph is the seam.
