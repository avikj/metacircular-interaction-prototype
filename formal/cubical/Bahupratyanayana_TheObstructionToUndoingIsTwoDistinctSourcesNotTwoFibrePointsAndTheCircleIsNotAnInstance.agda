-- बहु-प्रत्यानयनम् — प्रत्यानयनस्य प्रतिबन्धो द्वौ भिन्नौ मूलौ, न तु द्वौ तन्तु-बिन्दू ।
--
-- (the obstruction to undoing a map is two distinct SOURCES over one
--  target — not two points of the fibre; and the circle is not an
--  instance of it.)
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHY.  `notes/Yogyanupalabdhi_…md` §५, walking the corpus's directed
-- sector, found exactly ONE theorem of the form "this loss cannot be
-- undone" — `SetTruncationDescentBoundary.noDescentS¹` — and closed with
-- the instruction that the next build should not be a better extractor
-- but *more theorems of that kind*, because "the bottleneck is the
-- mathematics, not the extraction."
--
-- This file is the GENERATOR of that kind, at the level of points, plus
-- the exact statement of what it cannot reach.
--
--   §२  the law   : two points of one fibre WITH DISTINCT SOURCES kill
--                   every retraction.  Four lines, no h-level, no
--                   decidability, no finiteness, arbitrary A and B.
--                   Positive form: a retraction makes every fibre
--                   source-thin.
--   §३  instance  : the discrete log has NO LEFT INVERSE.  0 and 3 both
--                   land on ε, so no `r : C₃ → ℕ` undoes `powg`.  This is
--                   the corpus's second irreversibility theorem and its
--                   first outside homotopy.
--   §४  instance  : `सर्वैकम् : Bool → Unit`, the standing archetype.
--   §५  THE BOUNDARY, and it is the point of the file: `Tantujala`'s
--       बहु — two distinct points of a fibre — IS NOT ENOUGH.  Exhibited:
--       `एकवृत्तम् : Unit → S¹`, `tt ↦ base`, HAS a retraction, and its
--       fibre over `base` is `ΩS¹ ≃ ℤ`, so बहु holds of it.  Its two
--       fibre points differ only in their WITNESS; their sources are
--       equal.  So बहु does not obstruct undoing, and §२'s hypothesis is
--       strictly stronger than बहु — which no module in this corpus had
--       said.
--   §६  therefore `noDescentS¹` is NOT an instance of §२ and cannot be
--       made one: S¹ is connected, so it has no two distinct points to
--       feed the law.  Its obstruction is π₁ — one level up.  **The
--       corpus has two kinds of irreversibility and neither reduces to
--       the other**, and §५ is the witness that the reduction fails.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- RELATION TO WHAT IS ALREADY HERE, so nothing is silently re-proved.
--
--   `Tantujala_…`            बहु as one of three fibre verdicts.  §५
--                            sharpens it: बहु is not the obstruction to
--                            undoing.  The three-verdict codomain is
--                            untouched and remains correct for what it
--                            classifies.
--   `Sesa_…` §5              prices `सर्वैकम्`'s loss at one bit and proves
--                            `¬ isEquiv`.  §४ here is the RETRACTION
--                            statement, which is different and weaker
--                            than `¬ isEquiv` in general.
--   `GhataTantu_…`           exhibits the two exponents.  §३ consumes
--                            them; the fibre analysis is not re-done.
--   `Nirdharana_TheReturnLocus…`  the SECTION side: with `q ∘ s ≡ id` the
--                            return locus is `im s`.  This file is the
--                            other side: when no RETRACTION exists at
--                            all.  The two are not the same direction and
--                            neither implies the other.
--   `Arpitanarpita_….न-प्रत्यानयनम्` and `AHIMSA_SUTRA`'s
--   `नास्ति-प्रत्यानयनम्`      are two hand-proved instances of the same
--                            shape.  §२ is the law they are instances of;
--                            both are left standing and neither is
--                            rewritten (ROUTES KEPT).
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Not that §२ is new mathematics — "a left inverse
-- forces injectivity" is elementary and is not claimed as anything else.
-- What is claimed is that it is the GENERATOR the census asked for, that
-- §३ is a checked no-return theorem the corpus did not have, and that §५
-- is a counterexample separating it from `Tantujala`'s बहु.  No physics.
-- No computational hardness: §३ is about a three-element group and says
-- nothing about difficulty.  प्रत्यानयन is the corpus's existing word
-- (AHIMSA_SUTRA §५); no text is claimed for the compound or for any
-- statement below.
--
-- CHECKED: exit code in the session log; --cubical --safe, no postulates,
-- no holes.

--
-- `GhataTantu` exhibits 0 and 3 over ε.  Their sources are 0 and 3, and
-- `znots` separates them.  So no `r : C₃ → ℕ` undoes `powg` — checked,

-- ५ · THE BOUNDARY.  बहु IS NOT THE OBSTRUCTION.
--
-- `एकवृत्तम् : Unit → S¹` sending tt to base HAS an undo (`r _ = tt`,
-- and `r (f tt) ≡ tt` is refl).  Its fibre over `base` is `Σ[Unit] ΩS¹`,
-- which has two distinct points — `(tt , refl)` and `(tt , loop)`,
-- distinct because `winding` separates them in ℤ.  So `Tantujala`'s बहु
-- holds of a map that is perfectly undoable.
--
-- The two fibre points differ only in their WITNESS; their sources are
-- both `tt`.  §२'s hypothesis is therefore STRICTLY STRONGER than बहु,
-- and the strengthening is exactly the difference between a path in the
-- base and a point of the source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ६ · शेषः — why `noDescentS¹` is a different theorem, stated and not
--     proved here.
--
-- §२ needs two points of A that are provably distinct.  S¹ is connected,
-- so it has none: `base ≡ base` is inhabited by `refl`, and the law
-- cannot fire anywhere on it.  `SetTruncationDescentBoundary.noDescentS¹`
-- obstructs the truncation's retraction all the same, and the reason is
-- π₁ — the loop, not the points.  §५ is the witness that the reduction
-- genuinely fails rather than merely being unfound: there the loop-level
-- distinctness is present, the point-level distinctness is absent, and
-- the retraction EXISTS.  So the corpus's two no-return theorems live at
-- two levels and neither implies the other.
--
-- NOT PROVED HERE: that S¹ has no two distinct points (that is
-- connectedness, in the library, and is not invoked); and nothing about
-- higher levels — whether the pattern continues at π₂ and above is not
-- addressed and no conjecture is offered.
