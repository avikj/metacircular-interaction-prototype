-- Dviḥpāṭha — the antichain bound on anubandhas is not tight, and what
-- buys the difference is permission to recite a sound twice.
--
-- SOURCE.  Pāṇini, *Aṣṭādhyāyī* (~500 BCE), opens with the fourteen
-- Māheśvara-sūtras: the sounds laid in ONE recited line, each sūtra closed
-- by an anubandha.  A pratyāhāra names a class as the stretch from a sound
-- to a marker; the formation rule is 1.1.71 ādir antyena sahetā.  The line
-- is a *pāṭha*, a recitation, and one sound in it is recited TWICE — ha,
-- in sūtra 5 (ha ya va ra Ṭ) and again in sūtra 14 (ha L) — which is why
-- the tradition must say which ha a given pratyāhāra takes.  *Dviḥpāṭha*,
-- "twice-recited", is the grammarians' idiom for that; NO sūtra number is
-- claimed for the term itself, only for the phenomenon (sūtras 5 and 14).
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE IS ABOUT.  `PratyaharaLaghava_TheMarkerCountIsForcedBy-
-- TheAntichain.agda` proves the lower bound: classes ending at one marker
-- form a ⊆-chain, so a ⊆-antichain of width w forces w distinct markers.
-- Its own header records what it does NOT prove, in these words:
--
--     "That the antichain bound is TIGHT in general.  `markersDistinct`
--      gives markers ≥ width(F) and no more."
--
-- and reports, as a Haskell computation and explicitly not as a checked
-- term, width 14 over the 294 classes the śiva-sūtra line can name against
-- width 11 over the ~30 the grammar uses — three markers unforced by the
-- antichain argument.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.  The bound is NOT tight, and the gap is exactly the
-- resource `PratyaharaLaghava`'s model does not have.  On an abstract
-- three-sound inventory with the five-class family
--
--     F = { {s₁}, {s₁ s₂}, {s₁ s₂ s₃}, {s₃}, {s₂ s₃} }
--
--   §2  `विस्तारो-द्वयम्` — width(F) = 2: no three members of F are
--       pairwise ⊆-incomparable.  So the antichain bound says: 2 markers.
--   §4  `द्विःपाठं-विना-न-सिध्यति` — EXHAUSTIVE over all 120 arrangements
--       of s₁ s₂ s₃ M₁ M₂: not one names all five classes.  Two markers do
--       not suffice when every sound is recited once.  The bound is not
--       attained.
--   §5  `त्रिभिः-सिध्यति` — three markers do, recited once each:
--       s₃ M₁ s₂ M₂ s₁ M₃.  So the rep-free cost is exactly 3, not 2.
--   §6  `द्विःपाठेन-सिध्यति` — TWO markers suffice the moment a sound may
--       be recited twice: s₃ s₂ s₁ M₁ s₂ s₃ M₂ names all five.  The bound
--       is attained, on the same family, by the same two markers.
--
-- Together: width(F) = 2, and the minimum marker count is 3 without
-- dviḥpāṭha and 2 with it.  A bound proved in a model where each sound has
-- ONE position measures a different quantity from the one Pāṇini paid.
--
-- WHY THE EXHAUSTION IS COMPLETE (the WLOG, stated because §4 enumerates
-- permutations of exactly five tokens and a reader should not have to
-- trust that).  Let L be any line naming all of F with at most two markers
-- and each sound recited once.  F contains a class meeting each of s₁ s₂
-- s₃, so all three sounds occur in L.  width(F) = 2 with `markersDistinct`
-- forces two distinct markers, so exactly two occur.  Recited-once makes
-- every occurrence unique.  Hence L is a permutation of {s₁ s₂ s₃ M₁ M₂}
-- up to renaming the two markers, and §4 checks all 120 of them.  §3 also
-- checks that the enumeration really has length 120.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED, and the first of these is the one that matters:
--
--   * That this explains Pāṇini's residue of three.  It does NOT.  His
--     line DOES recite ha twice, so the gap 14 − 11 cannot be the total
--     absence of dviḥpāṭha.  What is removed is only the possibility that
--     the antichain bound is tight and the residue therefore an artefact.
--     Repetition is a real resource that moves the achievable count; a
--     bound proved without it cannot be assumed to be the true minimum.
--     The successor question is the graded one, and it is open: what is
--     the minimum over lines in which at most k sounds are twice-recited?
--     Pāṇini's line is the case k = 1.
--   * Petersen 2004 (essential uniqueness of the order; 14 minimal for the
--     full inventory).  Still not proved, still unread — egress is blocked
--     from this environment.  Inherited unchanged from `Sivasutra.agda`.
--   * Any phonological content for s₁ s₂ s₃.  They are three abstract
--     sounds.  The family F is not the grammar's family and is not offered
--     as one; it is a witness that the bound has slack.
--   * That Pāṇini stated any of this.  He stated the line.
--
-- CONVENTION, and it is load-bearing exactly once.  `klass s m` takes the
-- prefix before the FIRST occurrence of m, then the suffix from the LAST
-- occurrence of s inside it — the nearest preceding recitation, which is
-- what makes ha-in-sūtra-14 reachable at all.  Where every sound is
-- recited once, this agrees with `Sivasutra.from`/`between`'s first-
-- occurrence search, so §4's negative result does not depend on the
-- choice; §6's positive one does, and says so.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  Every claim below is `refl`: the
-- enumeration and the class extractor compute.
