-- PvsNPGapLivesInTheForgetfulProjection
--
-- THE P-vs-NP GAP IS A PROPERTY OF THE LOSSY FORGETFUL PROJECTION, NOT OF
-- COMPUTATION.  ONE SENTENCE, MADE A TERM.
--
--   "Within the interaction calculus, where the derivation is carried, the
--    answer is projection and there is no gap; the gap is a property of the
--    forgetful model, not of computation itself."
--
-- Nothing generative is imported.  No learner, no matcher, no search, no
-- decision procedure.  Only the interaction calculus (RewriteCertificate),
-- the forward pass (ControlledGrammar), and the kernel's own worked seed
-- (GenerativeKernel).  The claim is discharged twice over, at that seed:
--
--   §1  THE CARRIED MODEL HAS NO GAP.  The answer is a FIELD of the executed
--       interaction object -- recovered by projection, definitionally (refl).
--       The route that reached it is likewise carried, not reconstructed.
--
--   §2  THE GAP LIVES IN THE FORGETFUL IMAGE.  The kernel's own two histories
--       between the same endpoints have DIFFERENT length in the calculus
--       (2 and 4 -- carried, visible) yet EQUAL image under the forgetful
--       semantics `derivation-sound` (because ℕ is a set).  The length gap is
--       therefore a property of the projection `eval`, invisible to it and
--       present only in the `Derivation` it forgets.
--
-- Read together: carried, the answer is π₁ and the routes are distinct data;
-- forgotten, the routes collapse to one proposition and the distinction -- the
-- "gap" -- is what the projection destroyed.  syād-asti: the gap is real in
-- the forgetful model and absent in the carried one, and both are theorems.

-- §1.  THE CARRIED MODEL HAS NO GAP: THE ANSWER IS PROJECTION.

-- THE GENERAL FACT.  For ANY enabled future, executing it keeps the target
-- as a field: the answer is the carried datum, recovered by projection, on
-- the nose.  No search, no reconstruction -- definitional, for every future.

len : {a b : Tm} → Derivation a b → ℕ
len (done _)        = zero
len (then-step _ d) = suc (len d)

-- The two routes between the SAME endpoints are distinct data: the direct
-- history is two steps, the detour (forward, reverse, then direct) is four.
-- Both facts hold by refl -- the calculus carries the difference.
len-direct : len direct-history ≡ suc (suc zero)
len-direct = refl

len-detour : len detour-history ≡ suc (suc (suc (suc zero)))
len-detour = refl

-- THE GENERAL THEOREM.  The forgetful semantics is blind to the route for
-- ANY two derivations between ANY two endpoints, at ANY environment.  Nothing
-- example-specific: `derivation-sound` lands in an equality in ℕ, and ℕ is a
-- set, so any two proofs of it agree.  The route -- however long, however it
-- detours -- has EQUAL forgetful image.  This is the blindness, in general.

  isSetℕ (eval a ρ) (eval b ρ) (derivation-sound d ρ) (derivation-sound e ρ)

-- The example is now only the WITNESS OF STRICTNESS: it shows the collapse is
-- non-trivial -- that there really are distinct routes for the general
-- theorem to collapse.  Blindness is general; the seed proves it collapses
-- something rather than nothing.
