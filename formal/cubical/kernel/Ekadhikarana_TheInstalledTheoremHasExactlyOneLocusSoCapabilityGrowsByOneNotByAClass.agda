-- एकाधिकरण — one locus.
--
-- TERM.  अधिकरण · adhikaraṇa, "locus, substratum" — the place a property
-- resides.  It is a technical term in Nyāya (the locus of an absence, with
-- its counterpositive) and in Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā (the topic-section).  IT IS
-- USED HERE IN ITS ORDINARY SENSE ONLY — the term at which an operation
-- resides — and NO TEXT IS CLAIMED for the application, no author credited
-- with anything proved below, and no ledger row exists for the compound,
-- which is built here.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is not a limitation being recorded.
--
-- `ControlledGrammar.NativeOperation` carries an OPEN field:
--
--     Control       : Tm → Type₀            -- the caller supplies this
--     control-sound : {t : Tm} → Control t → t ≡ source
--
-- `Control` is arbitrary.  A caller may hand the kernel any predicate on
-- terms whatsoever, including a wildly permissive one, and the kernel
-- accepts it.  `control-sound` is the entire soundness surface.
--
-- The reading this file is written against, and rejects: that the kernel
-- "cannot generalise", that `install`'s default `Control t = (t ≡ lhs)`
-- is a placeholder awaiting a schema, and that the missing schema is a
-- defect.  §1 shows the restriction is not a property of the DEFAULT.  It
-- is forced on EVERY control the field can ever hold, in one line, and it
-- is what makes the open field safe:
--
--     HOWEVER PERMISSIVE THE CALLER'S CONTROL, THE OPERATION HAS AT MOST
--     ONE LOCUS.
--
-- So the design is: maximal caller freedom, zero soundness surface.  The
-- price is that capability grows by ONE TERM per installed theorem and
-- never by a class (§3), and that price is the feature.  A schema is a
-- claim about all its instances whose correctness is checked ONCE,
-- abstractly, after which it fires everywhere unexamined.  The kernel's
-- alternative is `apply-checked`, which TRANSPORTS the certificate to the
-- site: every firing arrives carrying a proof about that firing.  "Cannot
-- generalise" and "cannot be wrong at a site" are one sentence read twice.
--
-- AND THIS IS THE FIBRE LAW CHOOSING ITS BINDING.  `fibre/src/Fibre/
-- Carrier.agda`: for f : A → B, bind the OUTPUT and the fibre is
-- `singl (f a)`, contractible, so the datum rides free — that is the
-- schema, one proof and infinitely many free applications.  Bind the INPUT
-- and the fibre is `fiber f b`, the exact loss — one proof, one site, and
-- you pay again to move.  §2 computes the locus type of an installed
-- operation and it is literally a `singl`: contractible, one point, the
-- source.  The kernel is at the lossy binding on purpose.  `Asesa_…`
-- reports the same position from the soundness side.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--   §1  eka-adhikarana      any two loci of one operation are equal, for
--                           ANY Control, no hypothesis on the caller.
--   §2  adhikarana-eka      for `install d` the locus type is contractible
--                           and its centre is the source: EXACTLY one.
--   §3  adhikarana-sruta    a library fires only at sources: if some
--                           operation of a list is enabled at t, then t is
--                           the source of one of them.  Capability is the
--                           list of sources, so n theorems give n loci.
--   §4  na-vyapakam         the refusal made concrete: no NativeOperation
--                           fires at both `zero` and `suc zero`.  A schema
--                           would; that is exactly what §1 forbids.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here says a schematic kernel is impossible or
-- undesirable — it says THIS field cannot hold one while `control-sound`
-- stands, and prices what that buys.  Nothing computes an h-level for
-- `Control t` in general; §2 is about `install`'s default only.  §3 is
-- about the sources present in a list and says nothing about reachability
-- under iterated advance.
