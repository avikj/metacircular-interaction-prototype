-- स्थापना-वर्ग — the moduli of installations.
--
-- THE CLAIM (2026-09-03, the moduli conversation): the kernel is the
-- fixed point of the spec → moduli → motive tower — the one object
-- that is simultaneously a point of its own moduli, because `install`
-- turns a theorem of the object into a structure map of the object.
-- For that sentence to be mathematics rather than mood, the kernel's
-- self-extensions must be CLASSIFIED, and the classification must
-- name what a self-extension is over and above the theorem it
-- installs.  Here is the classification, and the answer is: a gauge.
--
--   §1  INSTALLATION LOSES NOTHING: extracting the certificate from
--       an installed derivation returns the derivation, by refl.
--       install is a section of extract — theorem → operation →
--       theorem is the identity.
--
--   §2  THE MODULI OF SELF-EXTENSIONS: a NativeOperation is exactly
--       a certificate together with a control gauge — a predicate on
--       terms and a soundness witness pinning it to the source.  The
--       equivalence is exhibited (both round trips refl, by η), so
--       "what is an operation beyond its theorem?" has an exact
--       answer: a choice of gauge, nothing else.
--
--   §3  EVERY OPERATION FACTORS THROUGH ITS OWN INSTALLATION: for
--       any O, reindexing controls along control-sound carries O's
--       applicability into that of install (checked O), and both
--       apply and apply-checked commute with the reindexing — each
--       agreement is refl.  So the image of install exhausts every
--       self-extension up to gauge: capability grows by one term per
--       theorem, as a factorization theorem, not a slogan.
--
--   §4  THE CANONICAL GAUGE IS THE WHOLE LOCUS: the applicability
--       space of install d is contractible with centre the source —
--       the one point there is to fire at — and §5: every gauge's
--       applicability space maps into that contractible locus over
--       the identity of terms.  However permissive the control, it
--       is a shadow of the one point.
--
-- Read together: self-extension is classified by derivation up to
-- control gauge; installation is the canonical — total, terminal —
-- gauge; and no gauge buys an application the certificate did not
-- already license (§3, by refl).  The Maurer–Cartan reading of
-- conservative self-rewrite lands here already solved: the coherence
-- equation is control-sound, its solutions are the gauges, and gauge
-- equivalence classes of solutions are the derivations themselves.
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY.  §§1–5 for this kernel's NativeOperation
-- as it stands.  NOT claimed: that install is an equivalence onto
-- operations (it is not — gauges differ), nor anything about
-- extensions that change Tm, Step, or eval themselves: this is the
-- classification of what `install` can reach, which is the kernel's
-- own stated growth axis.
