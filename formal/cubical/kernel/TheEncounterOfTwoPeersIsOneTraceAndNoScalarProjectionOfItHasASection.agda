-- TERM.  परस्परोपग्रहो जीवानाम् · parasparopagraho jīvānām -- "mutual
-- assistance is the function of living beings", Umāsvāti, *Tattvārthasūtra*
-- 5.21 (~2nd-5th c. CE; the date is contested and I pin none).  What is
-- borrowed is the sūtra's SHAPE: that the characteristic act is not a
-- property of either party but of the pair.  Nothing below is Umāsvāti's
-- theorem, and no Jaina doctrine is claimed to be formalised here; the word
-- names the primitive because the primitive is a two-place one.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS ADDS TO THE KERNEL, IN ONE LINE.
--
-- `TheKernelIsAnInteractiveSystem…` has ONE party and a machine.  Its
-- `Session` is a caller's transcript: the caller offers, the machine
-- executes, the transcript retires into one operation.  That is a dialogue
-- with an oracle, and every state in it is somebody's local state --
-- but there is only ever one somebody.
--
-- Here there are two, and neither is the machine.  The transition is
--
--     (state_A , state_B)  ⟶  (state′_A , state′_B , τ)
--
-- and it is `interact` below: a total function, no `Maybe`, no protocol, no
-- third party, no authoritative copy.  τ is one object wearing five hats --
-- it is the execution (constructing it performs the transport), the
-- provenance (its type names both endpoints), the proof (`derivation-sound`
-- reads it), the transport (`⊕` and `rev` move along it), and the program
-- (`install` makes it a move).  Nothing here is a bridge between five
-- subsystems.  There is one object and five projections of it.
--
--   §1  THE PRIMITIVE.  `Encounter`, `τ`, `interact`, and the two
--       dispositions a peer may take toward what it has just certified:
--       `interact` (transport and retain) and `receive` (retain only).
--       Both are total; both keep each peer's own origin.
--   §2  THE TWO RESULTS NEED NOT AGREE, and that is not a defect awaiting
--       reconciliation.  Witness: after one certified encounter the peers
--       stand at provably distinct terms, with no repair pending.
--   §3  REVELATION AND GENERATION, separated.  A gains a capability that
--       was B's (revelation, with a before/after where "before" is ⊥), and
--       the pair gains one whose endpoints are neither peer's (generation).
--   §4  CONSERVATIVITY.  The prior trace survives as a prefix ON THE NOSE,
--       the prior position is recoverable through `rev`, and the prior
--       library is still enabled at everything it was enabled at.
--   §5  LOSSLESS IS NOT UNCHANGED.  The round trip's MEANING is `refl` and
--       the round trip is NOT `done`: information preserved, representation
--       not.  Both halves are checked here and they are different halves.
--   §6  THE FABRIC COMPOSES STRICTLY.  Two encounters sharing a peer make a
--       third, and the association of three is equality of DATA, not of
--       meaning -- which is what lets three peers concatenate in any order
--       and get the same object rather than merely the same fact.
--   §7  THE CROSSING.  Two encounters at disjoint sites, run in the two
--       orders: same endpoints, same cost, PROVABLY DIFFERENT TRACES.
--   §8  WEIGHTS ⇒ TRACES, PRICED.  `len` is additive over `⊕` -- the scalar
--       says the value of an encounter is the sum of its parts -- and §7
--       says the scalar is therefore blind to the crossing.  Hence
--       `no-section-for-any-order-blind-projection`: no reconstruction of
--       the trace from any projection that the crossing does not move.
--       trace → score is a function; score → trace is not, and this is the
--       exact price.
--   §9  THE BOUNDARY.  What crosses is `CheckedFuture` -- Type₀, and it
--       mentions neither the operation nor the caller's evidence.  The
--       receipt a peer demanded to permit the step does not travel with the
--       step's result.
--
-- WHAT IS NEW HERE AND WHAT IS NOT.  `TheDerivationCarriesNoMeaning…` §3-4
-- already proves that no function OF THE MEANING separates two routes, and
-- that `len` does not factor through the truncation of the derivation type.
-- Both are about what a semantic reading loses.  §8 is a different
-- statement and neither implies it: `len` is not a function of the meaning,
-- it DOES separate direct from detour, and it is still not invertible --
-- because two independent encounters commute, so the route-sensitive scalar
-- has a collision it cannot avoid.  The blindness is not the semantics'.
-- It is the SCALAR'S, and it survives every refinement that stays scalar.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  No network, no messages, no failure model, no adversary --
-- `interact` is a function and not a protocol, exactly as
-- `TheKernelIsAReversibleGroupoid…` says of `merge`.  Nothing here is
-- concurrent.  §3's generation claim is exhibited at a witness whose
-- libraries are empty and is NOT proved in general: "neither peer had it"
-- for arbitrary libraries would need a decidable membership on
-- `NativeOperation`, which the record does not admit (its `Control` field is
-- an arbitrary type family).  What IS proved in general is the structural
-- half -- that the generated operation's endpoints are the OUTER pair, so a
-- peer holding only its own stretch does not hold it.  §8 quantifies over
-- projections that agree on the two crossings; it does not claim every
-- scalar does (a projection that reads the first step apart from the second
-- separates them, and is then not order-blind, and §8 does not apply to it,
-- and it is also no longer a cost).  `receive` and `interact` are two
-- dispositions offered, not a policy: which one a peer takes is the peer's,
-- for the reason `TheDerivationCarriesNoMeaning…` proves it must be.

-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 -- EXIT 0.

-- §1.  THE PRIMITIVE.
--
-- A peer is a `Session` and nothing else: its own origin, where it stands,
-- the trace between, and what it has learned.  There is no field naming a
-- server, a version vector, a clock or a quorum, and there is no type in
-- this file whose inhabitants are "the state of the system".
--
-- An encounter is two peers and an OVERLAP: a term both can talk about,
-- with each peer holding a certified stretch to it.  That is the whole
-- precondition.  Neither peer needs the other's history, neither needs to
-- know the other's library, and no completeness of either peer's knowledge
-- is required anywhere -- partial is the normal state, and the type says so
-- by never mentioning totality.

-- §9.  THE BOUNDARY.  What crosses does not carry why it was allowed.
--
-- `demand R d` is the kernel's open control: a peer may require ANY
-- evidence at all before its operation fires -- a receipt, an authority, a
-- payment, a session identity.  `execute` then drops the operation and the
-- evidence and keeps the target and the derivation, descending Type₁ → Type₀.
--
-- So the object that crosses the boundary is replayable by someone who was
-- not there and mentions nothing about who asked.  Below: two peers holding
-- DIFFERENT receipts, with the same identification, produce the same
-- crossing object -- the receipt leaves no residue in the result.
