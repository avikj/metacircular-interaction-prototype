-- TERM.  व्याप्ति · vyāpti — pervasion, the invariable concomitance that
-- makes an inference carry from the case at hand to every case of the same
-- mark.  Root notion in Gautama, *Nyāyasūtra* (~2nd c. CE) under अनुमान;
-- the vyāptivāda and the उपाधि that defeats a proposed pervasion are
-- Navya-Nyāya, Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi* (~1325).  The gap is stated
-- because filing the later apparatus under the sūtrakāra is the error this
-- corpus struck in its own Pāṇini row.  Carried second-hand from
-- `TheInstalledOperationHasNoPervasionSoTheKernelMemorises`; no text is
-- opened here and no Naiyāyika is credited with anything proved below.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES, in one sentence.
--
-- It gives the kernel's unit of learned behaviour a control that carries
-- its own INSTANCE and its own LOCUS, so one installed theorem fires at a
-- `Tm × Locus`-indexed family of contexts instead of at one term — and it
-- does so with NO new soundness obligation, because the two lemmas that
-- discharge it are structural recursions the calculus already admitted.
--
-- THE SITUATION IT ANSWERS.  Two records stood side by side and only one
-- of them was wired to anything:
--
--   `ControlledGrammar.NativeOperation` — what `install` produces, what
--     `EnabledFuture` / `advance` / `Branch` / `merge` / `retire` are all
--     typed against.  `TheInstalledTheoremHasExactlyOneLocus…` proves it
--     can never pervade: `control-sound : Control t → t ≡ source` forces
--     `eka-adhikarana` for EVERY control a caller can supply, so capability
--     grows by one TERM per theorem and never by a class.
--
--   `TheInstalledOperationHasNoPervasion….SchematicOperation` — control
--     carrying a substitution witness, proved STRICTLY more expressive
--     (`no-native-operation-does-this`).  It produces no NativeOperation,
--     so it cannot enter `EnabledFuture`, cannot be stepped by `advance`,
--     cannot be merged, cannot be retired.  A proof of expressiveness
--     standing BESIDE the executable kernel rather than inside it.
--
-- So `learn = install ∘ CheckedFuture.derivation` — the metacircular step,
-- "the transcript of a session is the machine's stock of moves" — closed
-- only over GROUND facts.  Every session taught the machine exactly one
-- key/value pair, and `kernel-cannot-reach-a-tower` exhibits that on the
-- kernel's own library.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE TWO MISSING LEMMAS, and why neither is a new axiom.
--
-- §1  SUBSTITUTION ACTS ON THE REWRITE CALCULUS.  `subStep` and `subDer`:
--     every `Step` constructor commutes with `subVar` on the nose, by
--     structural recursion, six clauses.  This is the DERIVATION-level
--     companion of `eval-subVar`, which was already in RewriteCertificate
--     and which `TheInstalledOperationHasNoPervasion…` used to make
--     SchematicOperation sound at the level of MEANING.  Doing it at the
--     level of the CERTIFICATE is what lets the schema keep the kernel's
--     defining property — that `apply-checked` transports a proof to the
--     site, so every firing arrives carrying a proof about that firing —
--     instead of degrading to a meaning-only operation.
--
-- §2  CONTEXT ACTS ON THE REWRITE CALCULUS.  `weaveDer`, lifting
--     `IntrinsicRewrite.weave-step` from `Step` (and `Run`) to
--     `Derivation`.  `IntrinsicRewrite` proved one local motion reweaves
--     through any one-hole `Locus`; `Derivation` is what a
--     `NativeOperation` actually carries, and the lift had not been taken.
--
-- Substitution and locus are orthogonal and pervasion needs both: a rule
-- should fire at `subVar u lhs` PLUGGED ANYWHERE.  §4's control is exactly
-- that pair, and §3's `apply-checked` is `subst` of `weaveDer l (subDer u
-- checked)` — the certificate travelling through both.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--   §1  sub-step / sub-derivation      substitution acts, structurally
--   §2  weave-derivation               context acts, structurally
--   §3  Operation, apply-checked,      the unified record; soundness by
--       operation-is-sound             the transported certificate alone
--   §4  ground / schematic / pervading three instances of ONE record;
--       native→operation               and every NativeOperation is one
--   §5  fires-at-two-contexts,         a pervading operation fires at two
--       no-native-operation-does-this  contexts differing in BOTH the
--                                      instance and the locus, which §1 of
--                                      TheInstalledTheoremHasExactlyOne…
--                                      forbids to every NativeOperation
--   §6  Future, advance, advance-      the wiring: the same no-premature-
--       preserves-branch-count         collapse law, over Operation
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  `ControlledGrammar` is NOT edited: `NativeOperation` keeps
-- its type and `eka-adhikarana` stays true of it — §4 embeds rather than
-- replaces, so nothing downstream is invalidated.  No decision procedure
-- for `Control` is given; §5 exhibits instances and does not search for
-- them.  Nothing scores, ranks or samples the enabled list.  `Session`,
-- `retire` and `merge` are NOT re-typed over `Operation` here — §6 does
-- `advance` only, and the rest is named and left.  The substitution is for
-- ONE variable (`var`, via `subVar`), the only one `RewriteCertificate`
-- defines; the other five `Env` coordinates are not schematic.

-- §3.  THE UNIFIED RECORD.
--
-- The single change from `NativeOperation` is the type of `control-sound`.
-- There, the enabling evidence at `t` is an identification of `t` with ONE
-- term, which is what `eka-adhikarana` reads off in a line.  Here it is an
-- identification of `t` with the operation's left-hand side AT AN INSTANCE
-- AND IN A LOCUS, both of which the control itself supplies.  `Control`
-- stays an open field: the caller may still hand over any type family, and
-- the soundness surface is still exactly one equation.
--
-- `apply` now CONSUMES the control, where `NativeOperation.apply` was
-- constant.  That is forced — the output depends on the instance — and it
-- is the change §4 of `TheInstalledOperationHasNoPervasion…` priced in
-- advance: the enabled set maps many-to-one onto emissions, so the witness
-- must be kept.  `advance` already keeps whole futures and is forbidden to
-- dedupe, so the kernel was built for this.

-- §11.  CATEGORIFIED SOUNDNESS, AND IT IS FREE.
--
-- `TheCountingSemanticsIsADecategorification…` proves the ℕ-semantics keeps
-- a cardinality and drops the bijection, and builds the categorified
-- semantics in which every `Step` is an equivalence and every `Derivation`
-- a composite of them.  `apply-checked` hands back a `Derivation`.  So a
-- pervading operation carries the ARRANGEMENT to each site it fires at,
-- not merely the count — the bit that module proves a counting readout
-- provably cannot hold.  Nothing is added for it: this is `derivation-equiv`
-- of the certificate that already travelled.

-- §12.  THE BRANCHES NOW DIFFER IN THEIR TARGET, WHICH THEY NEVER DID.
--
-- `eka-adhikarana` gave every NativeOperation at most one locus, so the
-- futures at a seed all emitted the same term: `GenerativeKernel.run-
-- targets` is `target₀ ∷ target₀ ∷ []` — two proof-relevant HISTORIES, one
-- output.  `advance-preserves-branch-count` conserved a multiplicity whose
-- members were indistinguishable downstream.
--
-- With the locus carried, one theorem fires at a seed in more than one
-- PLACE, and the places emit different terms.  Here `plus-one` fires at
-- the outer `add` and at the inner one of the same seed:
--
--     add (add var (suc zero)) (suc zero)
--       ↦ suc (add var (suc zero))     instance = add var (suc zero), root
--       ↦ add (suc var) (suc zero)     instance = var, under-left
--
-- Both sound, by `operation-is-sound`, from the one certificate.  This is
-- the first place in the kernel where `advance`'s refusal to dedupe is
-- carrying a genuine choice rather than a duplicated one — and it is
-- exactly the choice `TheDerivationCarriesNoMeaning…`'s no-go says no
-- semantic criterion may make for the caller.  The machine presents both.
