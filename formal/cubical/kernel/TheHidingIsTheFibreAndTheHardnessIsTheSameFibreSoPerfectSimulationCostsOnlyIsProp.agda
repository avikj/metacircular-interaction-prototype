-- TERM.  गुप्ति · gupti -- guarding, concealment; from गुप्, to hide.  In
-- Jaina usage it is one of the means of saṃvara -- the three guptis, the
-- restraint of mind, speech and body -- but NOTHING doctrinal is claimed
-- here and no sūtra is cited: the word is taken in its plain sense, which
-- is concealment, because that is what §2 proves costs `isProp`.  (Sanskrit
-- has a technical vocabulary for secret communication -- Kauṭilya's
-- *Arthaśāstra* uses गूढ-compounds for it, and the Kāmasūtra's list of arts
-- includes म्लेच्छितविकल्प -- and NO first use, no attribution and no
-- anticipation is claimed for any of it.  The provenance ledger has no row
-- for this file and should not get one.)
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  IT WAS A GREP THAT MISSED IT.
--
-- The corpus proves the structural content of zero-knowledge in at least
-- five places and never once uses the phrase, so a search for the phrase
-- returns nothing and concludes, wrongly, that the mathematics is absent.
-- That is the exact error `NayaVada_` is about -- reading a projection and
-- reporting on the object -- and it is recorded here because the correction
-- is the theorem.  The five places:
--
--   `TheWholeDerivationTypeIsOneFibre…`  fibre-is-everything: a map into a
--     proposition has every fibre equal to its whole domain.
--   `TheDerivationCarriesNoMeaning…`     soundness-factors-through-truncation:
--     the verifier's view is a function of ∥ Derivation ∥₁ and not of the
--     derivation.
--   `TritiyaMarga_…`                     getting a witness back out of an
--     existence costs Markov's principle.
--   `fibre/` and abstracts/05             bind the output and the fibre is
--     contractible, free; bind the input and it is the exact loss.  Every
--     cryptographic construction sits at the second binding.
--   abstracts/19, abstracts/11            the same fibre in phonology, and
--     non-interference holding definitionally rather than approximately.
--
-- What no file does is put the two readings of that one fibre side by side.
-- This one does, and they turn out to be a single statement read twice.
--
--   §1  THE SETTING.  A witness type, a view type that is a PROPOSITION,
--       and the honest prover's map between them.  Three lines, no
--       protocol, no rounds, no coins.
--   §2  PERFECT SIMULATION COSTS `isProp` AND NOTHING ELSE.  The simulator
--       holds the statement and outputs the statement; the real transcript
--       and the simulated one are EQUAL -- not indistinguishable, not
--       computationally close.  One line, and it is the whole of hiding.
--   §3  AND THE VIEW SHRINKS NOTHING.  `fiber view v ≃ W`: after the
--       verifier has seen everything it will ever see, the space of
--       witnesses consistent with what it saw is the space it started with,
--       undiminished.  This is a stronger statement than §2 and it is where
--       the word "zero" is earned.
--   §4  EXTRACTION IS EXACTLY UNIQUENESS, in both directions.  The view is
--       invertible iff the witness was unique and the statement entails
--       one.  Both hypotheses are named because both are needed.
--   §5  SO HIDING AND HARDNESS ARE ONE FIBRE READ TWICE.  Two distinct
--       witnesses forbid extraction outright -- not "make it expensive",
--       forbid.  Hiding is that fibre being everything; hardness is that
--       same fibre being non-contractible.  ONE OBJECT, TWO READINGS.
--   §6  THE CANONICAL INSTANCE: `∣_∣₁` IS THE MODALITY.  Propositional
--       truncation is not merely a tool for stating hiding, it is the
--       maximal hiding view, and extraction from it is an equivalence
--       exactly when the witness is unique.
--   §7  THE KERNEL'S OWN INSTANCE, DISCHARGED WITH NO ASSUMPTION.  `sound`
--       is a perfect-hiding view, and at the kernel's own seed extraction
--       is impossible -- because two routes exist there, which is a term.
--   §8  THE ASYMMETRY.  Binding the output is contractible and free; the
--       whole price is at the other binding.  The prover gives away nothing
--       by evaluating.
--
-- THE SENTENCE, for this file.  A verifier is blind exactly to what its own
-- collapse identifies, and here the collapse is `isProp` on the view: the
-- statement type has no room to hold which witness, so it holds none, and
-- the amount it fails to hold is all of it.  Hiding is not achieved.  It is
-- what is left when a codomain has no capacity.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED, and the list is long on purpose because the gap between this
-- and a deployed proof system is exactly the list.
--
--   * NO COMPLEXITY AND NO PROBABILITY.  There is no cost measure, no
--     distribution, no negligible function and no polynomial-time
--     simulator anywhere below.  "Perfect" here means EQUAL, which is
--     stronger than indistinguishable -- and it is bought entirely by the
--     codomain being a proposition.  A protocol whose transcripts land in
--     something that is NOT a proposition gets none of this for free and
--     must pay with a simulator argument; nothing here says such a payment
--     is available, and §2 is not evidence that it is.
--   * NO SOUNDNESS AGAINST A CHEATING PROVER.  It is not proved and it is
--     not stated.  `view : W → V` says an honest prover's view comes from a
--     witness; it does NOT say that an inhabitant of `V` entails one.  §4's
--     `uniqueness-gives-extraction` takes `V → W` as a HYPOTHESIS for
--     precisely this reason.  At the kernel: `Meaning a b` can hold with no
--     `Derivation a b` -- that direction is completeness of the calculus and
--     is proved nowhere -- so the kernel is NOT a proof system in the
--     cryptographic sense, and §7 should not be read as saying it is.
--   * NO HARDNESS ASSUMPTION IS USED AND NONE IS PROVED.  §5's "hardness"
--     is non-invertibility of one map, which is the same reading abstracts/05
--     gives of the fibre law; the DEPLOYED assumption is instantiated there,
--     at modular exponentiation, and not here.
--   * NOTHING ABOUT ROUNDS, challenges, Fiat-Shamir, commitment schemes,
--     a verifier's coins, or any protocol whatsoever.  §1 is a map.
