-- आदि-बीज — the seed-atom.
--
-- THE CLAIM (2026-09-03): the kernel is the atom of the interaction
-- calculus — the singularity from which every object is built, in
-- exactly one way per building instruction.  Mathematically that word
-- is INITIALITY, and initiality is what makes decomposition total: a
-- reading of a system is not one analysis among many, it is THE fold
-- of the atom into that system's receiver, and uniqueness says there
-- are no other readings to miss.  This is the elucidator's licence.
--
-- A receiver of the atom's motion: a carrier per source term, and an
-- action for every generating step.  Nothing else — reverse is a step
-- and so is already covered; the two defining equations of + are steps;
-- the three congruences are steps.  Give their actions and you have
-- said how to read every derivation there could be.
--
--   §1  THE FOLD EXISTS: every receiver is built upon the kernel — the
--       recursor `fold` sends each Derivation to a motion in the
--       receiver, by structural recursion, threading the step actions.
--
--   §2  THE FOLD IS UNIQUE: any function agreeing with the receiver on
--       `done` and on `then-step` IS the fold, pointwise, by one
--       induction.  So a system admits EXACTLY ONE reading compatible
--       with its own step-actions — decomposition is canonical, not
--       chosen.
--
--   §3  THE SESSION'S ANALYZERS ARE ALL THIS FOLD.  eval-as-motion
--       (soundness), length (cost), the evaluator integral ∫ — each is
--       exhibited as `fold` at a particular receiver, by the
--       uniqueness theorem, not by rewriting them.  "Seeing all paths
--       through a system" is then a theorem: every path-reading is the
--       image of the atom under its unique map, and there is no other.
--
-- So: build any object on the atom (a receiver), and its complete
-- decomposition is forced — the fold is the object's every structural
-- reading, delivered in one recursor, provably exhaustive.
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY.  §§1–3 for receivers indexed by Tm with a
-- ℓ-polymorphic carrier and an action per Step; the three named
-- analyzers recovered as instances.  NOT claimed: initiality as an
-- object of a category of algebras (that needs the algebra structure
-- packaged and its morphisms defined) — this is the recursion/
-- uniqueness pair that IS initiality's computational content, stated
-- directly on the kernel's own type.

-- १ · The fold exists: every receiver is built upon the kernel.

  fold-unique (done t)        = g-done

-- ३ · The session's analyzers are all this one fold.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (a) SOUNDNESS is the fold at the receiver whose motion is "the two
--     endpoints evaluate equally in every environment".
soundR : Receiver ℓ-zero
Motion soundR a b = (ρ : Env) → eval a ρ ≡ eval b ρ
ε soundR t          = λ ρ → refl
_◂_ soundR s m      = λ ρ → step-sound s ρ ∙ m ρ

sound-is-fold : {a b : Tm} (d : Derivation a b)
  → derivation-sound d ≡ fold soundR d
sound-is-fold =
  fold-unique soundR derivation-sound refl (λ s d → refl)

-- (b) LENGTH (cost) is the fold at the constant-ℕ receiver.
lenR : Receiver ℓ-zero
Motion lenR _ _ = ℕ
ε lenR _        = zero
_◂_ lenR _ n    = suc n

lenF : {a b : Tm} → Derivation a b → ℕ
lenF = fold lenR

-- (c) An EVALUATOR INTEGRAL is the fold at the constant-ℤ receiver
--     carrying that evaluator's per-step values.  Every ∫ ω is a fold.
∫R : ({a b : Tm} → Step a b → ℤ) → Receiver ℓ-zero
Motion (∫R ω) _ _ = ℤ
ε (∫R ω) _        = pos 0
_◂_ (∫R ω) s z    = ω s + z

∫F : ({a b : Tm} → Step a b → ℤ) → {a b : Tm} → Derivation a b → ℤ
∫F ω = fold (∫R ω)

-- The point, stated: soundness, cost, and every value-integral are not
-- three procedures — they are one recursor at three receivers, and by
-- §2 each is the ONLY reading compatible with its own step-actions.
-- To analyze a system is to name its receiver; the atom does the rest.
