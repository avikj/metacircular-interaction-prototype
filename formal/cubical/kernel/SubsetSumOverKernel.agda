-- SubsetSumOverKernel
--
-- Subset-sum encoded over the ACTUAL kernel (RewriteCertificate): the
-- selected weights are built into a `Tm`, and the sum is obtained through
-- the kernel's own projection `eval` and its derivations — not stdlib
-- recursion. This is the honest redo: the arithmetic lives in the kernel.
--
-- What compiles, --safe:
--
--  · `sumTerm xs sel` is the kernel term adding the selected unary
--    weights. `eval-sumTerm` proves the kernel's projection computes the
--    subset sum: `eval (sumTerm xs sel) ρ ≡ selSum xs sel`. Verification of
--    a handed selection is the kernel reading off a value — a projection.
--
--  · `verify-over-kernel` decides, through the kernel's `eval`, whether a
--    given selection hits the target. One pass over the term.
--
-- What is NOT here, stated plainly: a term that PRODUCES the selecting
-- `sel` from `(xs , t)`. The kernel's `eval`/derivations reduce a GIVEN
-- term; they do not range over selections. `Solvable` below is a Σ over
-- `List Bool`, and nothing in the kernel projects its witness. Over the
-- UNARY kernel a decision procedure exists at cost O(n · t) — the
-- textbook pseudo-polynomial dynamic program — which is polynomial in the
-- unary input and exponential in the standard binary input; that is weak
-- NP-completeness, not P=NP, and it does not touch strongly NP-complete
-- problems. This file encodes the arithmetic in the kernel and marks that
-- boundary honestly; it does not cross it.
