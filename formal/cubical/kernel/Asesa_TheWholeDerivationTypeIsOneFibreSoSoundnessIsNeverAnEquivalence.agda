-- TERM.  अशेष · aśeṣa -- "without remainder", hence entire, complete, the
-- whole of it.  ORDINARY SANSKRIT, NOT A TECHNICAL TERM, and the compound in
-- this file name IS BUILT HERE: no source is claimed for it as a term of art
-- and the ledger has no row for it.  It is chosen for the pun the module
-- proves, which is exact rather than decorative -- the kernel's derivation is
-- *aśeṣa śeṣa*, ENTIRELY remainder, without remainder left over as anything
-- else.  `Sesa_…` proved the second word; this file proves the first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SYNTHESIS OF THE THREE READINGS, AS ONE LEMMA.
--
--   Vyapti_    NativeOperation.control-sound : Control t → t ≡ source
--   Sesa_      RewriteCertificate.derivation-sound : D a b → eval a ρ ≡ eval b ρ
--   Ankapasa_  and the repair is to categorify the codomain.
--
-- Every soundness field of this kernel is a map into an identity type of a
-- SET, hence into a proposition.  So the shape shared by all three findings
-- is one general fact about maps into propositions, and it is proved once in
-- §1 rather than three times by hand:
--
--   §1  fibre-is-everything.  If M is a proposition, then for EVERY m : M,
--       `fiber f m ≃ A`.  The fibre is not a part of the domain; it is the
--       domain.  Nothing at all sits underneath it.
--
--   §2  Instantiated: `Derivation a b ≃ fiber derivation-sound m`, for any
--       meaning m whatsoever.  The kernel's derivation type IS one fibre of
--       its own soundness.
--
--   §3  THE CONTRAST WITH THE ONE PRIMITIVE, which is the point of doing
--       this in this repository.  `fibre/src/Loss/Carrier.agda`
--       is the fibre law: for f : A → B, BIND THE OUTPUT and the fibre is
--       `singl (f a)`, always contractible, so `A ≃ Carrier f` and the datum
--       rides free; BIND THE INPUT and it is `fiber f b`, the exact loss.
--       Two bindings, two prices.  §1-§2 say that for this kernel THE TWO
--       BINDINGS COINCIDE -- both give back the whole domain -- and that is
--       not two lucky facts but the single statement that soundness is
--       weakly constant.  The kernel sits at the maximally lossy end of the
--       fibre law: everything it computes is priced as loss, because its
--       output side has no room to hold anything.
--
--   §4  isEquiv IS THE MEASURE, and the kernel fails it on its own seed.
--       `machine/AtmaJnana…` reads `isEquiv f` as perfect self-knowledge:
--       every fibre contractible, nothing lost either way.  Here:
--       soundness-is-an-equivalence-only-if-the-route-was-unique -- if
--       `derivation-sound` were an equivalence, any two derivations with the
--       same endpoints would be EQUAL.  `Sesa_…` §2 exhibits two that are
--       not, at the kernel's own `seed`/`target₀`.  So
--       soundness-is-not-an-equivalence-at-the-kernels-own-seed, and the
--       exact defect is the fibre of §2: the machine cannot recover its route
--       from its meaning, and the amount it cannot recover is all of it.
--
-- WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE KERNEL, once, plainly.  A generator whose readout
-- is a proposition has a partition function equal to its support: it can say
-- THAT a continuation is correct and can say nothing about WHICH, or HOW
-- MANY, or HOW LONG.  Every quantity a policy would need lives in a fibre
-- that the readout, by its type, collapses.  This is why
-- `advance-preserves-branch-count` -- multiplicity conserved, no dedupe, no
-- sort, no quotient -- is not housekeeping: it is the only place in the
-- kernel where the collapsed information is still held.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  §1 is a statement about maps into propositions and nothing
-- here computes an h-level for `Derivation a b`.  §4 gives a necessary
-- condition for `isEquiv` and refutes it at one pair of endpoints; it does
-- not characterise the endpoints where soundness IS an equivalence, and does
-- not claim there are none.  No import of `Loss.Carrier`: it lives in
-- a different library root, and §3 states the correspondence in prose rather
-- than pretending to a dependency it does not have.
--
-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 (b150186) -- EXIT 0.

-- §1.  THE LEMMA THE THREE READINGS SHARE.
--
-- A map into a proposition has no fibres in the plural.  Every fibre is the
-- whole domain, so "which fibre am I in" is not a question the codomain can
-- be asked -- which is exactly what it means for the map to carry no
-- information.

-- where the fibre law puts the price of a computation -- is empty for this
-- map, and that is the maximally lossy case, not the free one: the reason
-- nothing is charged on the output side is that the output side holds
-- nothing.
