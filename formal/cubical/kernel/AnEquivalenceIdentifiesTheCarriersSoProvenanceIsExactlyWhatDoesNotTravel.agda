--
-- TERM.  संक्रमण · saṃkramaṇa -- a crossing over, a passing from one place
-- to another.  Ordinary Sanskrit; no technical sūtra is claimed and the
-- provenance ledger has no row for it.  It is used here because it is the
-- word `interactive/`'s running machine already uses for this exact act,
-- and the second word below, व्यय · vyaya (expenditure, what is spent), is
-- that machine's word for the other half.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHERE THE DESIGN OF THIS FILE CAME FROM, WHICH WAS NOT THE SPECIFICATION.
--
-- The task text asked for `transport (ua e)` between two peers holding one
-- object in different representations, retaining the triple (a , e , b).
-- Written from that alone this file would have had ONE relation, `A ≃ B`,
-- and would have been wrong in a way that is invisible from inside it.
--
-- Turning the machine instead -- `sh interactive/run-yantra.sh --wire` --
-- and asking it to transport, and then asking it whether two
-- representations may be identified, produced three facts the specification
-- does not contain.  They are recorded because they are the file's design:
--
--   1. A TRANSPORT THAT SUCCEEDS STILL HAS A COST, AND THE MACHINE STATES
--      IT.  `saptabhangi.samkramana` returns a bijection with both round
--      trips run on all 8 positions of each side -- 16 checks, "no case
--      omitted, no case sampled" -- and calls it "an identification, in
--      Voevodsky's sense: a thing held, not a fact cited".  And in the same
--      answer, under `vyaya`, what did NOT travel: the two modules' glosses,
--      which differ, "the positions correspond; the accounts of WHY the
--      eighth exists do not, AND THE EQUIVALENCE DOES NOT CARRY THAT
--      DIFFERENCE."  A successful transport is not a free one.
--
--   2. IDENTIFICATION IS GRADED, IN THREE, AND THE COARSEST IS NEARLY
--      EMPTY.  `interactive/StandpointStore.hs` lines 36-42:
--          सत्य  satya  -- inhabited or not.  Coarsest.
--          अर्थ  artha  -- the set of witness labels.
--          मूल   mūla   -- the same labels FROM THE SAME SOURCES.
--      and the store, asked to relate two representations, answered
--      `satyaikya` and said why it reports that as a COUNT and not as an
--      index: "truth-value agreement is nearly universal and therefore
--      nearly contentless."
--
--   3. THERE IS NO THIRD ROAD.  Every answer that machine gives is a
--      saṃkramaṇa or a doṣa-lekha naming its losses one by one, and asked
--      whether the two representations may be identified it returned a
--      doṣa-lekha, twice, differently -- `syad-avaktavyam` under saha and
--      `syan-nasti` under krama.  Not a boolean either time.
--
-- SO THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE IS THE MIDDLE FACT, AND IT IS EXACT IN TYPE
-- THEORY.  The three grades are three strengths of identification:
--
--     Satya A B   =  ∥ A ∥₁ ≃ ∥ B ∥₁        both inhabited, or neither
--     Artha A B   =  A ≃ B                   the carriers identified
--     Mula  pA pB e = (a : A) → pB (e a) ≡ pA a    and the SOURCES agree
--
-- `ua` and `transport` deliver ARTHA.  §3 proves satya is strictly weaker
-- than artha, and §4 proves ARTHA IS STRICTLY WEAKER THAN MŪLA -- one
-- equivalence, two provenance maps that disagree.  That gap is `vyaya`, and
-- it is the machine's finding turned into a term:
--
--     AN EQUIVALENCE IDENTIFIES THE CARRIERS AND SETTLES NOTHING ABOUT
--     WHERE EITHER SIDE GOT ITS COPY.
--
-- which is why a peer-to-peer transport must CARRY its provenance
-- separately or lose it silently, and why the retained object is the triple
-- (a , e , b) and not b.
--
--   §1  the three grades, and the two implications that do hold, both free.
--   §2  transport COMPUTES -- `uaβ` -- and the round trip is exhibited in
--       both directions, so the identification is held and not cited.
--   §3  SATYA ⊊ ARTHA.  Unit and Bool: both inhabited, not equivalent.
--   §4  ARTHA ⊊ MŪLA.  The theorem.  One equivalence, two sources.
--   §5  THE RETAINED TRIPLE, and that its middle component is not
--       recoverable from its ends -- so a peer that stores only the value
--       has not stored the transport.
--   §6  NO THIRD ROAD.  `Uttara` has two constructors and the interaction
--       is total; there is no `Maybe`, no error, and no silent case.
--   §7  the fixed-representation encounter is the identity instance, so
--       `TheEncounterOfTwoPeers…` is this file at `e = idEquiv`.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  No representation of any actual data structure: `A` and `B`
-- are arbitrary types and no tree, sequence or serialisation appears.  §4
-- exhibits the gap at a two-element witness and does not measure it in
-- general -- how much provenance an equivalence fails to carry is not a
-- quantity this file defines.  Nothing about networks, wire formats, or
-- content addressing (§14 of the task text is untouched).  `Mula` is a
-- commuting square over ONE chosen pair of provenance maps; it is not a
-- claim that provenance is always a map into a fixed type, and a peer whose
-- sources are structured differently needs a different square.
--
-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 -- EXIT 0.

-- §1.  THE THREE GRADES.
--
-- Read as the machine reads them: what two peers may be said to agree

-- from; `Mula` says the identification respects that.

-- the path manufactured from the equivalence transports BY that
