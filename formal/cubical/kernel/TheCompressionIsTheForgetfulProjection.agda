-- TheCompressionIsTheForgetfulProjection
--
-- The bridge between WindingCostIsUnarySize, ForgetfulCompressionPricesTheDrop
-- and the fibre law. `eval` at a fixed environment is the compression from a
-- term (a derivation-carrying, structured object) down to its value. It is a
-- forgetful map, and its INPUT-side fibre — the terms that reach a given
-- value — is exhibited non-contractible: over `a + b` the compression
-- identifies the structured sum `a + b` with the bare value `unary (a+b)`,
-- two provably distinct terms. That collapsed structure is exactly what the
-- forgetful projection drops. The winding (unary) value agrees with the
-- computed value (`eval-unary`), so the drop is the additive/derivation
-- structure, not the number.
