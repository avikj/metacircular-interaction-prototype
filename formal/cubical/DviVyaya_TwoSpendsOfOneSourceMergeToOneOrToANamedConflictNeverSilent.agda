-- द्विव्यय — "double expenditure" (dvi = two, vyaya = spending/outgoing).
-- COMPOUND BUILT HERE, 2026-08-24; not a classical citation.  It names the
-- object exactly: two spends of one exclusive source.  English gloss follows
-- the underscore per the file-naming rule.
--
-- WHAT THIS DISCHARGES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
--
-- It discharges the LOCAL half of the exclusive-resource frontier
-- (docs/build/ExclusiveResourceOrdering_ResearchDesign.md §2.2, Candidate B):
-- once two individually-valid spends of one source are in ONE merged view,
-- the double-spend is NEVER SILENT.  `verdict` is a TOTAL, decidable function
-- returning either
--   · Exclusive  — all held spends of the source are identified (≤ 1 distinct), or
--   · Conflict   — a NAMED pair of distinct held spends (a typed avaktavya,
--                  Saptabhangi.क्रम-सह-भेदः: the saha pair surfaced, not voted on).
-- And the alarm is merge-monotone: a Conflict in EITHER view survives the
-- join-semilattice union (`conflict-++ˡ/ʳ`).  So the substrate's own merge,
-- not a global order, discharges detection.
--
-- It does NOT solve the GLOBAL residue.  Nothing here forces both spends into
-- one view; that is `_∈_` reachability / permissionless gossip-completeness —
-- the one genuinely open frontier — and it is deliberately OUTSIDE this module.
--
-- IT ALSO CORRECTS THE CONJECTURE AS WRITTEN.  §4 models a spend as
-- `Spend src = Σ[snk] (spend src ≡ snk) = singl (spend src)`, which is ALWAYS
-- contractible (एकसूत्र: isContr (singl x)); so its `Exclusive` is
-- unconditionally true and `MergeExhibitsConflict` is inhabited by `inl` for
-- the wrong reason — it is the graph of a function, not the set of SUBMITTED
-- valid spends.  The faithful model is a Discrete set of submitted spends
-- (equality = content-address equality, decidable); double-spend is that set
-- failing to be a proposition.
