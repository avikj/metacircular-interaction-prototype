--
-- PROVENANCE, stated first, because CLAUDE.md's file-naming rule (note 2)
-- requires a module whose mathematics does not originate in the traditions
-- this repository reads to SAY SO rather than carry a fabricated Sanskrit
-- label.  This file has no Sanskrit name because its content is not Indian.
-- Its objects are, with text and date:
--
--   * G. Kirchhoff, Ann. Phys. Chem. 64 (1845) 497–514 (the node and loop
--     laws) and 72 (1847) 497–508 (the incidence matrix, the spanning tree,
--     the count |E| − |V| + 1).  `∂`, `d`, `Δ` below are his.
--   * H. Poincaré, "Analysis Situs", J. École Polytech. (2) 1 (1895) 1–121:
--     incidence matrices as boundary operators, ∂∂ = 0.
--   * B. Eckmann, Comment. Math. Helv. 17 (1945) 240–255: Δ = δd + dδ on a
--     finite complex; on a graph the dδ term is empty.
--   * The substrate: the cubical Agda library, v0.5, commit 132a2a3 —
--     `Cubical.Algebra.Matrix`, `Cubical.Algebra.Ring.BigOps`,
--     `Cubical.Algebra.Group.Subgroup`, `Cubical.Algebra.Group.QuotientGroup`.
--     Per CLAUDE.md ("Tools are not frames"), this is the checker, not an
--     interpretation of anything.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  `formal/cubical/` holds 808 modules, of which 799
-- import from the cubical library; 1 imports `Cubical.Categories` and 0
-- import `Cubical.Cohomology`, `Cubical.Homotopy`, `Cubical.Displayed`,
-- `Cubical.Structures` or `Cubical.Modalities`.  The owner, 2026-08-14
-- 01:56:19Z: "you waste compute on solved problems and don't even import
-- all the most powerful machinery/existing constructs".  This module takes
-- ONE hand-rolled object in this corpus and redoes it on the library's own
-- structures, in order to measure the difference exactly.
--
-- THE OBJECT.  `KirchhoffIncidence_GraphLaplacianIsDivGradAndSummationBy
-- PartsIsExact.agda` (cf-tessera-i-0, 2026-08-20) and, at the far end,
-- `NaturalMachine/FiniteGraphCohomology.agda`.  Nothing in either is
-- modified, and nothing in either is wrong; what is reported here is what
-- the library already had.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED.  No new mathematics.  Four claims, all of
-- them about provenance inside this toolchain:
--
--   (1) §1.  Two of the three finite-sum facts that i-0's §0 records as
--       "facts about finite sums that the library does not ship" ARE
--       shipped.  Fubini is `∑Exchange` in `Cubical.Algebra.Matrix`; the
--       empty sum is `∑0r` = `bigOpε` in `Cubical.Algebra.Monoid.BigOp`.
--       Both are proved here BY the library term.  The third, `∑δ`, is
--       genuinely absent and is one `∑Ext` from `∑Mulr1`.
--       `∑Exchange` needs only a `Ring`; i-0's `∑Swap` was stated over a
--       `CommRing`.  This is a report, not a repair: i-0's file is i-0's.
--
--   (2) §2.  Kirchhoff's incidence matrix is a `FinMatrix`, `grad` and
--       `div` are `mulFinMatrix`, and i-0's Theorem 2 (summation by parts)
--       and Theorem 3 (Δ = B Bᵀ) are BOTH the single library lemma
--       `mulFinMatrixAssoc`, one line each instead of five.  The
--       commutativity hypothesis disappears: everything in §2 holds over
--       an arbitrary ring.
--
--   (3) §3.  What the library supplies that neither hand-rolled module
--       has at all: `grad` is an `AbGroupHom`, so `ker grad` and `im grad`
--       are SUBGROUPS (`Cubical.Algebra.Group.Subgroup`), the gauge
--       quotient is a GROUP (`Cubical.Algebra.Group.QuotientGroup`) rather
--       than a bare set-quotient type, and exactness at C¹ is a theorem in
--       both directions.  `NaturalMachine/FiniteGraphCohomology.agda` has
--       `H¹ = C¹ / GaugeStep` as a type with no group structure, and no
--       statement that the kernel of the quotient map is the image of δ⁰.
--
--   (4) §4.  A claim of my own, refuted: I claimed the library's Fubini
--       was unusable here because it would need commutativity.  It is
--       proved at `Ring`, and it is instantiated below at a ring that is
--       demonstrably NOT commutative — the 2×2 matrices over ℤ, with the
--       non-commutativity witnessed.
--
-- WHAT BLOCKS MORE.  Stated in the rigor boundary at the bottom, with the
-- library paths, because "we should import nLab" is worth nothing next to
-- "here is exactly what is missing".
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical library v0.5 (commit 132a2a3) — this
-- container, NOT the pin in BUILD.md.  --cubical --safe, no postulates, no
-- holes, EXIT 0, and — unlike i-0's module — no warnings, because nothing
-- here pattern-matches on `Cubical.Data.FinData.Fin`.  The concrete 2×2
-- matrices of §4 are written with the Kronecker delta instead of by a
-- match, which is what avoids the "relies on injectivity of ℕ.suc" report.
--
-- Author: cf-tessera-s-0, 2026-08-20.  Credit: cf-tessera-i-0 for the
-- Kirchhoff module this measures against, and cf-tessera-n-0 for the
-- twisted-Leibniz module that landed beside it the same day.

-- 3.  What the library has that neither hand-rolled module has:
--     the cochain spaces are GROUPS and the gauge quotient is a GROUP
--
--   `NaturalMachine/FiniteGraphCohomology.agda` defines
--       H¹ = C¹ / GaugeStep
--   as a set quotient — a bare Type₀ — and proves that an additive
--   functional killing coboundaries descends to it.  There is no group
--   structure on H¹, no statement that GaugeStep's classes are the cosets
--   of a subgroup, and no exactness statement.
--
--   The library supplies all three, for any group homomorphism, and they
--   are collected here once, abstractly, then applied to `grad`.

-- 3.1  Generic: the cokernel of a homomorphism into an abelian group,
--      with exactness at the middle.  Everything here is library machinery
--      (`imSubgroup`, `isNormalIm`, `_/_`, `effective`); what is added is
--      the two exactness implications, which the library does not state.

-- 4.  THE REFUTATION.
--
--   The claim I formed on first reading i-0's §0, and held long enough to
--   write into a draft of this header: "i-0 had to hand-roll ∑Swap because
--   the library's Fubini, if it exists at all, is stated for commutative
--   rings — the ∑ machinery lives under CommRing in this corpus, so the
--   library's version would not have applied."
--
--   Both halves are false.  `∑Exchange` is proved in
--   `Cubical.Algebra.Matrix` inside `module _ (R' : Ring ℓ)`, and it is
--   used there to prove associativity of matrix multiplication — which is
--   precisely the case where the ring cannot be assumed commutative,
--   because the matrix ring it constructs is not.
--
--   The check that kills the claim: instantiate `∑Exchange` at the ring of
--   2×2 matrices over ℤ, and then exhibit two elements of that ring that
--   do not commute.  If the claim were true the first line would not
--   typecheck; the second line shows the instance is not vacuous.
--
--   (Guarding the negative: this is a witnessed non-identity, not an
--   exhaustion over a domain that might be empty.  `E01` and `E10` are
--   explicit elements and the two products are compared at an explicit
--   index, so there is no empty-enumeration escape.)

-- Rigor boundary, and what blocks a wider import.
--
-- CHECKED HERE.  Over an arbitrary ring and an arbitrary finite directed
-- multigraph: grad is the potential difference; Δ = ∂d as matrices, by
-- `mulFinMatrixAssoc`; summation by parts, by the same lemma; constants
-- are harmonic.  Over an arbitrary ring: grad and div are AbGroupHoms,
-- ker grad and im grad are subgroups, H¹ = C¹/im(grad) is a group, the
-- class map is a homomorphism, and the sequence is exact at C¹ in both
-- directions.  Over ℤ: the 2×2 matrix ring is not commutative, and
-- `∑Exchange` applies to it.
--
-- REFUTED.  My own claim that the library's Fubini would need a
-- commutative ring.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing about spectra, positive semidefiniteness (needs an
-- order), the matrix-tree theorem, the rank of Δ, β₁ = |E| − |V| + c (the
-- count needs a notion of dimension this file does not have), or H⁰ ≅ Rᶜ.
-- Nothing here computes H¹ for any particular graph.
--
-- WHAT BLOCKS GOING FURTHER, precisely, in cubical v0.5 (commit 132a2a3):
--
--   1. There is NO `Cubical.Algebra.ChainComplex`, and no chain- or
--      cochain-complex development anywhere in the library (checked by
--      `find` over the whole tree).  So the long exact sequence, the snake
--      lemma, and Hⁿ of a complex are unavailable; the exactness in §3 had
--      to be proved by hand from `effective`.
--
--   2. `Cubical.Cohomology` in v0.5 is Eilenberg–MacLane cohomology OF A
--      TYPE: `coHom n G A = ∥ (A → EM G n) ∥₂`
--      (Cubical/Cohomology/EilenbergMacLane/Base.agda).  It takes a space
--      and an abelian group, not a cochain complex.  A finite graph's
--      combinatorial H¹ is therefore NOT an instance of it without first
--      building the graph's geometric realisation as a type and proving a
--      comparison theorem.  This is the sharpest single answer to "why
--      does a corpus full of cocycles import zero cohomology": the
--      library's cohomology is about spaces, and this corpus's cocycles
--      are about matrices.
--
--   3. `Cubical.Categories.Abelian.Base` DOES define `IsKernel`,
--      `IsCokernel` with their universal properties, and `PreAbCategory`.
--      But `Cubical/Categories/Abelian/Instances/` contains exactly one
--      file, `Terminal.agda`, and `Cubical/Categories/Additive/Instances/`
--      likewise.  `Cubical.Categories.Instances.AbGroups` builds the
--      category of abelian groups but does NOT show it preadditive.  So
--      the universal property of the cokernel is definable and has no
--      instance to apply it to; getting it for H¹ means proving AbGroup is
--      a preadditive category first.  That is a real, bounded task and it
--      is the highest-value single import this corpus could make.
--
--   4. `mulFinMatrixrDistrAddFinMatrix` and its left twin are stated only
--      for square matrices (`∀ {n} (M N K : FinMatrix R n n)`) although
--      their proofs are dimension-generic; `mul-additive` above re-proves
--      the rectangular case in three lines.
--
--   5. `Cubical.Algebra.Ring.BigOps` does not re-export `∑Exchange`; it
--      sits in `Cubical.Algebra.Matrix`, which is why it was missed.  A
--      grep for "Fubini" or "Swap" in `Cubical/Algebra/` finds nothing
--      relevant.  This is a discoverability failure, not an absence.
