-- SimplicialDefectFailure
--
-- the defect family σ ↦ δ_σ of a charted Chu space is a functor on the
-- DEGENERACY half of the simplex category and on no more.  The prose
-- proof is not redone here; this module is its finite kernel-checked
-- shadow.
--
-- HEADLINE STATEMENTS (all checked, no postulates, no holes, --safe):
--
--  1. holonomy-dup      Prop. 2, degeneracy invariance, BY EQUALITY.
--     defect-dup        s_j preserves the first and the last vertex and
--                       inserts one factor ρ_{i_j i_j} = e, so
--                       𝔥_{s_j σ} ≡ 𝔥_σ and hence δ_{s_j σ} ≡ δ_σ.
--                       Unconditional on ρ: the only law used is a
--                       RIGHT UNIT for the composition.  No inverses,
--                       no associativity, no cocycle condition, no
--                       hypothesis on X, 𝒯 or Q.
--
--  2. faces-fail-covariantly     Prop. 3, the single counterexample, in
--     faces-fail-contravariantly which BOTH variances fail at once, on
--                       the same face operator d₀ at adjacent
--                       dimensions.  X = {a,b}, |𝒯| = 1, I = {0,1,2,3},
--                       ρ₁₃ = ρ₃₁ = sw and every other ρ = id.  The
--                       holonomies are computed by the kernel (refl);
--                       the two failures of inclusion are decided, not
--                       asserted.  Exhaustive as a negative because
--                       Q_α = (𝒫(X), ⊆) is a POSET: a morphism exists
--                       iff the inclusion holds, so "no inclusion" IS
--                       "no functorial relation" (note §1).
--
--  3. cocycle⇒trivial   Prop. 4, the sharp form, forward direction:
--     cocycle⇒defect-const  a cocycle ρ forces 𝔥_σ ≡ e for every σ and
--     cocycle⇒faces-act     hence δ constant, hence functorial along
--                       every face in both variances.
--
--  4. covariant⇒trivial          §4, THE CONVERSE, and it holds in ONE
--     covariant⇒holonomy-trivial variance only.  If δ_σ ⊑ δ_{d₀σ} for
--                       every σ (the SIMPLICIAL variance, and only d₀ is
--                       assumed) then δ_σ ⊑ δ_e for every σ — in
--                       (𝒫(X),⊆) that is δ_σ = ∅.  Iterating d₀ reaches
--                       a 0-simplex, whose holonomy is cap(ρ_ii)·e = e.
--                       With separating tests this gives 𝔥 ≡ e, and
--                       CocycleExtraction.Corpus.trivial⇒cocycle then
--                       gives ρ_jk ρ_ij = ρ_ik.  So in the simplicial
--                       variance the note's slogan is a THEOREM:
--                       face-functorial ⟺ δ = 0 ⟺ ρ a cocycle.
--
--  5. Cosimplicial-sharp-fails-corpus   §5, and this AMENDS the note.
--     Cosimplicial-sharp-fails-archive  In the COSIMPLICIAL variance
--                       (δ_{d_jσ} ⊑ δ_σ) the slogan is FALSE.  Chart:
--                       X = ℤ with Aut(X) ⊇ ℤ acting by translation,
--                       I = {0,1}, ρ_ij = 1 for i ≠ j, ρ_ii = 0,
--                       separating tests.  ρ is NOT a cocycle and
--                       δ_{(0,1,0)} ≠ ∅, yet δ_{d_jσ} ⊆ δ_σ for EVERY σ
--                       and EVERY j.  Q_α is thin, so the inequalities
--                       ARE a functor: the face half of note (O6) is
--                       satisfiable off the cocycle locus.  Proved for
--                       BOTH readings on the same chart — the good locus
--                       is the block simplices under the corpus reading
--                       and the constant simplices under the archive
--                       one, and both are closed under vertex deletion.
--
--  6. shadow-support-infinite   §7 (note §5.3 / Cor. 5.3).  If one
--                       simplex has nonempty defect then its iterated
--                       degeneracies are pairwise distinct and all carry
--                       the SAME defect, so Σ_σ |δ_σ| is 0 or infinite:
--                       the scalar shadow of
--                       SHRINKING_TESTS_LOWER_CURVATURE.md Def. 1.5 is a
--                       two-valued predicate, not a count.
--
-- THE TWO READINGS OF THE HOLONOMY (note §0.3) — load-bearing for this
-- encoding.  D0016 §B reads 𝔥_σ = ρ_{i₀iₙ} ρ_{i_{n-1}iₙ} ⋯ ρ_{i₀i₁},
-- with NO inverse on the long edge; SHRINKING_TESTS_LOWER_CURVATURE.md
-- Def. 1.4 reads 𝔥_σ = ρ_{i₀iₙ}⁻¹ ρ_{i_{n-1}iₙ} ⋯ ρ_{i₀i₁}, and only
-- the latter is the descent obstruction.  This module is AGNOSTIC
-- between them, deliberately, in two separate ways:
--
--   * §1 abstracts the long-edge factor as an arbitrary `cap : G → G`.
--     Both readings are instances (cap = idfun, cap = inverse), and the
--     degeneracy theorem is proved once for all caps.
--   * §2's counterexample lives in Aut(X) ≅ ℤ/2, encoded as (Bool, _⊕_),
--     where g⁻¹ = g, so the two formulas literally coincide.  The
--     instance below takes cap = idfun, and `cap-irrelevant-in-ℤ/2`
--     records that any cap whatsoever with cap false ≡ false and
--     cap true ≡ true — in particular both readings — gives the same
--     numbers.
--
-- §3 is the one place where the readings differ, and the module says so
-- in its hypothesis rather than hiding it: Prop. 4 is proved under
-- `cap-inv : ∀ g → cap g · g ≡ e`, which holds for the corpus reading
-- and fails for the archive one.  §4 needs only `cap e ≡ e`, true of
-- both; §4′ proves SEPARATELY what each reading yields (cocycle for the
-- corpus one; ρ² = e plus a closure identity for the archive one — the
-- note's "a 1-simplex carries ρ²", now a checked term); §5's chart
-- refutes the cosimplicial sharp form under BOTH readings at once.
-- Nothing here chooses between the readings: that is the owner's
-- (note §7.3), and the module converts the ambiguity into a pair of
-- theorems instead.

-- §4.  The SHARP FORM, converse half, COVARIANT (simplicial) variance
--
-- Note §9's slogan: "δ is functorial along faces exactly when ρ is a
-- cocycle, i.e. exactly when δ is zero."  Note §7.4 records the converse
-- as NOT claimed.  It is proved here — for ONE of the two variances, and
-- §5 shows it is FALSE for the other, which is the substantive finding
-- of this extension and amends the slogan.
--
-- Covariant (simplicial) direction: a simplicial structure would give
-- δ_σ → δ_{d_jσ}, i.e. δ_σ ⊑ δ_{d_jσ} in the poset Q_α.  Only d₀ is
-- used, so the theorem holds under a WEAKER hypothesis than full
-- simpliciality.
--
-- Mechanism, in one line: iterating d₀ walks any simplex down to a
-- 0-simplex, and 𝔥 of a 0-simplex is cap(ρ_ii)·e = cap e · e = e.  So
-- δ_σ ⊑ δ_e for every σ; in (𝒫(X),⊆) with δ_e = ∅ that is δ_σ = ∅.
--
-- ARCHIVE-AGNOSTIC.  The only hypothesis on the long-edge cap is
-- `cap-e : cap e ≡ e`, which holds for BOTH readings of §0.3 (cap =
-- inverse, corpus Def. 1.4; cap = idfun, D0016 §B).  Unlike §3, this
-- half of the sharp form does not distinguish the readings at all.

-- §5.  The sharp form is FALSE in the CONTRAVARIANT (cosimplicial)
--      variance — a charted Chu space, not a cocycle, whose defect
--      family IS functorial along every face.
--
-- This is new relative to the note, and it amends note §9's slogan and
-- closes half of note §7.4's open classification.  The claim proved:
--
--   there is a charted Chu space with ρ NOT a cocycle, δ_{σ₀} ≠ ∅ for
--   an explicit σ₀, and δ_{d_jσ} ⊆ δ_σ for EVERY σ and EVERY j.
--
-- Since Q_α = (𝒫(X),⊆) is a poset — thin — an assignment of morphisms
-- satisfying all the required inequalities IS a functor (every diagram
-- in a thin category commutes), so this is not "the inequalities hold
-- but coherence might fail": the face half of note (O6) is SATISFIABLE
-- off the cocycle locus.  What it does NOT rescue is the repair: note
-- §2.2's copower objection (δ_n must be σ-blind) is untouched, and the
-- simplicial variance is settled negatively by §4.
--
-- THE CHART.  X = ℤ, Aut(X) ⊇ ℤ acting by translation, so G = (ℤ,+).
-- I = Bool = {0,1}.  ρ_ij = 1 for i ≠ j and 0 for i = j.  Tests
-- separate points (∼_S is equality on ℤ), so
--     δ_σ = {x : 𝔥_σ + x ≠ x} = ∅ ⟺ 𝔥_σ = 0.
--
-- BOTH READINGS, and this is why the chart was chosen.  Writing t(σ)
-- for the number of consecutive-vertex changes in σ and ε(σ) ∈ {0,1}
-- for the long-edge indicator,
--     corpus  𝔥_σ = −ε(σ) + t(σ),   archive  𝔥_σ = ε(σ) + t(σ).
-- So the good locus is {t = ε} for the corpus reading (the "block"
-- simplices i…i j…j, at most one change) and {t = 0 = ε} for the
-- archive reading (the constant simplices).  BOTH are closed under
-- deleting a vertex, so BOTH readings give a cosimplicially
-- face-functorial δ, with different good loci.  The pair of theorems
-- replaces a choice between the readings.

-- §6.  What §4 and §5 leave standing, stated so no one over-reads them.
--
--  * §4 is the converse the note declined to claim (§7.4), in the
--    SIMPLICIAL variance, from a weaker hypothesis (d₀ only), and it is
--    agnostic between the two readings of the holonomy.
--  * §4′ converts note §0.3's discrepancy into two theorems instead of
--    a choice: corpus reading ⇒ cocycle; archive reading ⇒ ρ² = e and a
--    different closure identity.  Nothing here resolves which reading
--    D0016 §B intends; that is the owner's (note §7.3).
--  * §5 REFUTES the cosimplicial half of the slogan.  It does NOT
--    rescue the realization repair: note §2.2's objection (the copower
--    forces δ_n to be σ-blind, hence ρ-independent) is untouched by any
--    functoriality result, and §2.1's variance correction stands.
--  * §5 amends note (O6): the face part is refuted for the ρ of §2 but
--    is SATISFIABLE for the ρ of §5, so "faces act in neither variance"
--    is a statement about that counterexample, not about all charts.
--  * The example of §5 uses X = ℤ, hence an infinite Chu space; §2's
--    example is finite.  No claim is made that a finite chart with the
--    same property exists.
