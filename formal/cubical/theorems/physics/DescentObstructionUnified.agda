-- DescentObstructionUnified
--
-- "THE SAME DESCENT LEMMA, CHECKED THREE TIMES, NEVER UNIFIED" —
-- CHECKED, AND THE COUNT IS WRONG.
--
--
--     ProjectionChargeAudit.noChargeDescent
--   = SieveFiber "no section is charge-preserving"
--   = 0593 "novel-outcome→no-square"
--       — same descent lemma, checked three times, never unified
--
-- The corpus's own standing guard is that an identity between objects of
-- different types is its recurring failure mode, so the claim needs the
-- map EXHIBITED.  This module exhibits what exists and refuses what does
-- not.  The finding, stated before the terms:
--
--   * TWO of the named results are one lemma.  `descentObstruction`
--     below is that lemma; `recover-ProjectionChargeAudit` and
--     `recover-SieveFiber` are its instances at the two loci, and each
--     is checked here to be the type of the original.
--
--   * THE THIRD NAMED RESULT INSIDE `SieveFiber` IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT
--     PROOF.  `noChargePreservingSection` is a one-line corollary of
--     that file's own §7 `noChargeDescent` — take the descended map to
--     be `charge ∘ s`.  `section-from-descent` below is that derivation,
--     stated abstractly.  Two of the synthesis's three entries therefore
--     live in one file and one of them is downstream of the other.
--
--   * 0593's `novel-outcome→no-square` IS NOT THIS LEMMA, and the
--     synthesis's "=" is wrong there.  See §3: its certificate is a
--     MISSED POINT of a codomain, not a SEPARATED PAIR in a domain; it
--     needs no quotient, no identification, and no set-truncation
--     argument.  The two are the kernel side and the image side of a
--     factorisation, which is why they look alike in prose.  §3 states
--     the general image lemma and then shows the two certificate forms
--     are not interconvertible without extra data.
--
-- So the honest count is: ONE lemma, checked TWICE (in two files), with a
-- corollary and a different (dual) lemma also in the frame.  "Checked
-- three times" overstates by one and misidentifies one.
--
-- CHECKED ON THE PIN.  `formal/cubical/check.sh` with NM_MODULES set to
-- this module printed "RUNNING AGAINST THE PIN" (agda 2.8.0 at
-- /root/Agda-2.8.0/…, cubical /root/agda-libs/cubical-v0.9), EXIT=0
-- (errors: 0, warning lines: 0), CHECKSH_EXIT=0 read unpiped.  Scope,
-- verdict on THIS module and its import closure — which here includes
-- `ProjectionChargeAudit` and `SieveFiber`, since §2.3
-- instantiates against them.  `--safe`, no postulates, no holes.

-- §1  THE LEMMA, once.
--
-- A datum `c : A → B` descends along the quotient A → A/R only if it is
-- R-invariant.  A single related pair on which c differs refutes every
-- candidate — not "we found none": the Σ-type quantifies over all of
-- them.  This is `NEGATIVE_KNOWLEDGE_IS_TYPED` §1's T1 certificate form.
--
-- The proof is the composite path
--     c a₀ ≡ c̄ [a₀] ≡ c̄ [a₁] ≡ c a₁
-- whose middle step is `cong c̄` applied to `eq/`.  Both files below have
-- exactly this term; nothing else about their settings is used, which is
-- the content of the claim that they are one lemma.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Descends : (A → B) → Type (ℓ-max (ℓ-max ℓ ℓR) ℓB)

  descentObstruction c a₀ a₁ r sep (c̄ , agrees) =
    sep (sym (agrees a₀) ∙ cong c̄ (eq/ a₀ a₁ r) ∙ agrees a₁)

-- The non-quotient form the two files also use: no factorisation of c
-- through any map that identifies a₀ with a₁.  Stated outside the
-- relation-indexed module above, because no relation appears in it —
-- which is itself the observation that the quotient in
-- `ProjectionChargeAudit` and `SieveFiber` §7 is presentation, not
-- content.
module _ {A : Type ℓ} {V : Type ℓR} {B : Type ℓB} where

  FactorsThrough : (A → V) → (A → B) → Type (ℓ-max (ℓ-max ℓ ℓR) ℓB)
  FactorsThrough q c = Σ[ c̄ ∈ (V → B) ] ((a : A) → c̄ (q a) ≡ c a)

-- §1.1  The corollary the synthesis counted as a third proof.
--
-- "No section is charge-preserving" — `SieveFiber.noChargePreservingSection`
-- — asks for `s : V → A` with `c (s (q a)) ≡ c a`.  Compose: `c ∘ s` is
-- a factorisation of c through q.  So the section statement is the
-- factorisation statement pre-composed, and carries no extra content.

-- §2  THE TWO INSTANCES, with the map exhibited.
--
-- Each `recover-…` below is stated at the ORIGINAL type of the theorem
-- it recovers, so that the typechecker — not this comment — certifies
-- that the general lemma covers it.  §2.1/§2.2 give the shapes; §2.3
-- then IMPORTS the two original modules and applies the general lemma to
-- their actual objects, so the identification is checked against
-- `ProjectionChargeAudit.Local`/`R` and `SieveFiber.Vis`/`q`/`charge`

--
-- with `Square = (q : Q) (x′ : X′) → r q (stateMap x′) ≡ r′ q x′`.
-- Stripped of the propositional truncation (which is bookkeeping — the
-- proof is `PT.map`), it is the lemma below: a commuting square pushes
-- the image of the revised response into the image of the old one, so a
-- point present after and absent before refutes the square.
--
-- WHY IT IS NOT §1.  Compare the two certificates:
--
--   §1  needs  a PAIR a₀ a₁ IN THE DOMAIN, identified by the quotient and
--              separated by the datum.  Obstruction to a map OUT of a
--              coequaliser; the content is that c is not R-invariant.
--   §3  needs  a POINT y IN THE CODOMAIN, hit after and missed before.
--              Obstruction to a map INTO an image; the content is that
--              one image is not contained in the other.
--
-- One is a kernel statement, the other an image statement.  They are the
-- two halves of a first-isomorphism-theorem shape, which is exactly why
-- both read in prose as "the new thing does not descend".  Neither is an
-- instance of the other: §1 requires an identification (and gives none
-- of a codomain point), §3 requires a codomain point (and identifies
-- nothing).  `imageObstruction` below uses no quotient, no relation, and
-- no separated pair — the absence is the argument.
