-- संरक्षण-वृद्धिः — saṁrakṣaṇa, guarding/conservation; vṛddhi, growth
-- (both ordinary Sanskrit; vṛddhi is also Pāṇini's technical name for
-- the strengthened vowel grade, Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.1.1 vṛddhir ādaic — taken
-- here ONLY in its ordinary sense of increase; nothing grammatical is
-- claimed).  Compound built here, 2026-08-23, for the owner's U0023
-- (collab/upstream/raw/U0023.txt).
--
-- THE OTHER HALF OF THE ADMISSION GATE.  ApurvaIndriyam (imported)
-- checked the NOVELTY criterion: one blind pair separated by a proposal
-- refutes every possible derivation of it from the present sensorium.
-- U0023 supplies what was missing — CONSERVATION:
--
--     "Form the enlarged sensorium S'(x) = (S(x), q(x)).  The old
--      sensorium is recovered exactly: S = π₁ ∘ S'.  So S' is not
--      merely novel.  It is a conservative extension. ...
--      Every old distinction remains readable, and at least one
--      previously invisible distinction becomes visible.
--      Permanent conservative refinement is organogenesis.
--      Temporary conservative refinement is attention."
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED:
--   §1  युगपत् — the joint eye ⟨S,q⟩, and BOTH projections are refl-
--       factorings: the old sensorium and the proposal are each
--       recovered from the joint reading with h = fst, h = snd.
--       Conservation costs nothing and holds always, for every q.
--   §2  the strict-refinement relation ≺: S ≺ S' iff S flows through
--       S' and S' does not flow through S.  Data, not truncated —
--       the factoring is handed over, the refutation is a function.
--   §3  the growth theorem: a single witnessed blind pair upgrades
--       the always-true conservation to STRICT refinement:
--       S ≺ ⟨S,q⟩.  Novelty reuses ApurvaIndriyam's अपूर्वम् verbatim
--       — the two halves are one construction, exactly as U0023 says
--       ("safe attention and safe organogenesis are one construction").
--   §4  what strictness refuses: ⟨S,q⟩ ≺ ⟨S,q⟩ is uninhabitable — no
--       eye strictly refines itself, so growth cannot be faked by
--       re-reading the same organ (the identity factoring on the left
--       contradicts the required refutation on the right).
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Temporary-versus-permanent (attention versus
-- organogenesis) is a statement about INSTALLATION over time, not
-- about the reading maps, and no type here carries time; U0023's
-- distinction between them is therefore cited, not checked.  Nothing
-- about which q is worth adjoining: fitness and need are the
-- attention organ's subject, absent here.
