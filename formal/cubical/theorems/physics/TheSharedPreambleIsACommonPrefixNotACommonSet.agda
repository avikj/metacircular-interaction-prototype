-- TheSharedPreambleIsACommonPrefixNotACommonSet
--
-- `machine/TraceLibrary.hs` computes the shared helper preamble of its
-- trace records as `foldr1 lcp` — the longest common PREFIX — after its
-- own `selfTest` refuted the first version, which had assumed the whole
-- preamble was shared ("records disagree on the helper preamble: 16 of
-- 17", the module catching its own author).
--
-- Why the prefix and not the intersection is the right meet, checked:
--
--   * the common prefix IS the greatest common prefix (§2), so `lcp` is
--     a meet and not a heuristic;
--   * the common SET is not a preamble at all (§3) — two records can
--     share every declaration and have empty common prefix, and any
--     ordering of the shared set fails to be a prefix of one of them.
--
-- That second half is what makes the choice forced rather than
-- conservative: a preamble is a sequence whose later lemmas may cite
-- earlier ones, so a set of declarations is not a preamble until it is
-- ordered, and no single ordering serves two records that disagree.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT I READ FIRST
--
-- `machine/TraceLibrary.hs` end to end, including
-- `sharedPreamble recs = Right (foldr1 lcp (map (fst . splitAtCandidate
-- . recBody) recs))` and its `selfTest`.  The declaration names below —
-- `addZero`, `addSuc` — are that file's own, and `addZero : (a : ℕ) →
-- (a + zero) ≡ a` is the lemma its header says every record carries.
--
-- ADJACENT AND NOT MERGED.  `Anuvrtti` proves that a
-- measure sensitive to inheritance does not descend to the rule SET, and
-- §3 here is the same shape one level down — order carrying what the set
-- does not.  They are different statements about different objects and
-- neither derives the other: Anuvrtti is about a cost failing to factor
-- through `asSet`; §3 is about a common set failing to BE a preamble.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing about the 16-of-17 figure — that is a
-- count over `machine/replay.traces` and is that module's, not restated
-- here.  Nothing about whether `lcp` finds the LARGEST useful preamble
-- in practice; §2 is about the order, not about how much is shared.
--
-- CHECKED on the CONTAINER (Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — NOT the declared
-- pin, Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9).  --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- 4.  The reading
--
-- §2 says `foldr1 lcp` is not a conservative guess: it computes the
-- greatest object of the right kind.  §3 says the tempting alternative —
-- take the declarations both records share — is not an object of that
-- kind at all, because a preamble is a SEQUENCE and a set has to be
-- ordered before it can be one.  Two records sharing every declaration
-- can share no prefix.
--
-- So the first version of that module was not merely optimistic; the
-- notion it reached for does not exist.  Its `selfTest` caught the
-- symptom (16 of 17 disagree) and the choice of `lcp` is the cure, and
-- §2–§3 are why the cure is forced.
