-- उपाधि — the defeating condition, and a gate that has one.
--
-- TEXT AND DATE.  उपाधि / *upādhi*, the adventitious condition under
-- which a pervasion fails: Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, c. 1325, and the
-- Navya-Nyāya schools after him.  The rule the term carries is that a
-- universal claim is licensed not by the number of confirming instances
-- but by having searched for the condition that would break it and stated
-- the extent of the search; an inference with an undetected upādhi is not
-- knowledge, however many instances stand behind it.
--
-- SCOPE.  `Primes.Shodhita` and `Primes.Ekam` in 944676e4 hold a gate at
-- every step of a Mertens walk, `|M(k)|² ≤ k`, and report it as
-- "the mertens fragment of RH" and "RH-fragment: |M(k)| ≤ √k for all
-- k ≤ 400".  Two things are wrong with that label and one thing is right.
--
--   The gate is the MERTENS CONJECTURE, in its non-strict form: Mertens
--   stated |M(x)| < √x, the gate here asks |M(k)|² ≤ k.  It was DISPROVED
--   — Odlyzko and te Riele, "Disproof of the Mertens conjecture",
--   *Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik* 357 (1985),
--   138–160, which shows limsup M(x)/√x > 1 and so refutes the
--   non-strict form as well.  There is a k at which the gate fails.  No walk anybody can run will reach it, which is
--   exactly why a walk returning `true` at 60 and at 400 carries no
--   information: the upādhi is known to exist and is known to be out of
--   reach of the search.
--
--   The gate is also not the hypothesis.  RH is equivalent to
--   M(x) = O(x^(1/2+ε)) for every ε > 0, which is strictly weaker than
--   |M(k)| ≤ √k and is not expressible in this file, having no reals in
--   it.  Calling the strong false statement a fragment of the weaker open
--   one runs the implication backwards.
--
--   What is right is the arithmetic.  M(60) = −1 and M(100) = +1 are the
--   published values and they are recomputed below off the certified
--   factorization, not off a boolean sieve.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES.  It separates the two propositions into two types
-- so the conflation becomes a type error rather than a wording problem.
-- `MertensConjecture` is the universal statement.  `AllGate n` is the
-- finite check.  `restrict` maps the first to the second at every n, and
-- there is deliberately no term in the other direction, because the other
-- direction is the error and it is false.  `checkedTo20` is the finite
-- fact as a proof object rather than a flag.  The prefix is 20 and not
-- Shodhita's 60 because `AllGate n` recomputes the walk at every k, which
-- is quadratic in certified factorizations; the length of a finite check
-- is the one quantity this file is arguing does not matter.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  The 1985 disproof is not formalised here and
-- nothing below shows `MertensConjecture` is false; it is cited, and the
-- citation is why the label is withdrawn.  No tradition is credited with
-- the Möbius function or with anything proved here; *upādhi* names the
-- epistemic defect and is not offered as a source for the mathematics.
