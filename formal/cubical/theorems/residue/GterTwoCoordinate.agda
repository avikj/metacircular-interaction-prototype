-- §§4.1–4.2 and §4.7 (which specifies this module and states plainly
-- that it was neither written nor checked; this file is that
-- D0026 §7.3, owner Deltas 37–38,

-- lines 2456–2700.
--
-- WHAT IS BEING SETTLED.  D0026 §7.3 asserts, with no proof and no
-- witness, that the two coordinates of the Gter defect
-- 𝔤(P,Σ) = (E(P), ⋏_Σ) are independent:
--
--     "A state space can be fully separated while its boundary
--      description fails to compose.  A cut can compose perfectly while
--      its probes collapse distinct states."
--
-- The source note replaces the assertion by a SURJECTIVITY theorem onto
-- a 2×2 grid (its Theorem 4), on the shape (|Σ₀|,|Σ₁|,|Σ₂|) = (1,2,1),
-- with both of D0026's requested witnesses appearing as two of the four
-- cells.  Everything in it is decidable on a two-element carrier, hence
-- refl after Boolean evaluation.  That is this module.
--
-- THE ENCODING (source note Definition 4.1, taken literally).  A finite
-- cut system is 𝔖 = (Σ₀,Σ₁,Σ₂ ; 𝔗₀₁, 𝔗₁₂, 𝔗₀₂) with the 𝔗 relations,
-- and here relations are Bool-valued tables on finite index types:
-- Rel A B = A → B → Bool.  The glued realization is relational
-- composition, which over a two-element cut is a binary `or` — that is
-- the (−1)-truncation of the coend ∫^{Σ₁} 𝔗₀₁ ⊗ 𝔗₁₂, existential
-- quantification over Σ₁ = {b₁,b₂}.  The probe pool is the
-- INTERFACE-INTRINSIC one of Definition 4.2 (the two profile maps L and
-- R), which is the pool with the greatest separating power available at
-- the interface; any smaller pool only makes the theorem easier.
--
-- Σ₀ = Σ₂ = Unit and Σ₁ = Bool, with b₁ := true and b₂ := false.  Both
-- coordinates are then functions of the SAME data (𝔗₀₁, 𝔗₁₂), which is
-- the whole point of §4.1: the independence is not manufactured by
-- letting probes and gluing range over unrelated parameters.
--
-- WHAT THE FOUR CELLS SAY, once checked:
--
--     𝔖₁  S_L = S_R = {b₁}       sep = T , comp = T
--     𝔖₂  S_L = {b₁}, S_R = {b₂} sep = T , comp = F   witness (i)
--     𝔖₃  S_L = S_R = {b₁,b₂}    sep = F , comp = T   witness (ii)
--     𝔖₄  S_L = S_R = ∅          sep = F , comp = F
--
--   witness (i)  — a perfect instrument on a broken interface: the
--     probes separate the two cut states completely, yet no cut state
--     carries the direct a ⇝ c process, so the tear is nonzero.
--   witness (ii) — a perfect interface on a blind instrument: the
--     gluing reproduces 𝔗₀₂ exactly, so the tear vanishes, while the
--     probes cannot tell b₁ from b₂ at all.

-- CONTENTS
--
--   §1  Rel, Σ₀/Σ₁/Σ₂, _⊙_   the relational cut system and the glued
--                            realization.
--   §2  L, R, sep, comp,     Definition 4.2's intrinsic probes, the two
--       tear, cell           coordinates, and the tear against a
--                            declared direct realization.
--   §3  𝔖₁ … 𝔖₄              the four systems of the Theorem 4 table.
--   §4  row1 … row4          the table, four refls; `theorem4`, the
--       theorem4             four-cell surjectivity assembled from them.
--   §5  wit-i-*, wit-ii-*    Corollary 5's two witnesses.  The two sep
--                            statements are NOT new refls — each is a
--                            projection (`cong fst`) of its row, which
--                            is the honest bookkeeping: the witnesses
--                            ARE rows 2 and 3.  Two further refls carry
--                            the tear values.
--   §6  sep-not-a-function-  Theorem 4's stated consequence: neither
--       of-comp, and dually  coordinate is a function of the other.
--
--   SIX refl clauses in total (four rows, two tears), exactly as §4.7
--   predicted; everything else is derived from them.
--
-- RIGOR BOUNDARY — what is checked here, and what deliberately is NOT.
--
--   CHECKED.  Theorem 4 in full, as a surjectivity statement onto
--   Bool × Bool with an explicit cut system in every fiber; both of
--   D0026's witnesses, including their tear values against the declared
--   direct realization 𝔗₀₂ = {(a,c)}; and the two non-functionality
--   corollaries.  The relational composite is defined once, generally,
--   and the four systems are the only data supplied — every value below
--   is a kernel reduction, not a transcribed table.
--
--   NOT CHECKED, and the source note says so first (its §4.7):
--
--    (a) THEOREM 6, minimality of the shape (1,2,1).  It quantifies over
--        SHAPES — over all finite Σ₀,Σ₁,Σ₂ — and is the hand proof of
--        §4.2 (if |Σ₁| ≤ 1 then sep ≡ T; if Σ₀ or Σ₂ is empty then
--        comp ≡ F).  That is an argument about a family of index types,
--        not a Boolean table, and it is NOT refl-material.  Nothing
--        below claims the shape is minimal.
--
--    (b) PROPOSITION 7, non-invariance of the tear under truncation —
--        that replacing relations by Set-valued profunctors makes the
--        canonical comparison γ a 2-to-1 surjection on witness (ii), so
--        ⋏ = 0 relationally and ⋏ ≠ 0 in the Set-valued reading, on the
--        SAME cut system.  It needs the honest coend
--        ⨿_{b ∈ Σ₁} 𝔗₀₁(a,b) × 𝔗₁₂(b,c) and the comparison map: a real
--        construction, not a Boolean table.  NOT refl-material and not
--        attempted.
--
--        Consequence to keep in view, since this module lives entirely
--        on the relational side of it: `tear` below is the
--        (−1)-truncated tear, and by Proposition 7 that is a CHOICE of
--        truncation level, not the tear.  A tear reported as one symbol
--        has already discarded the non-injective half of γ — which is
--        exactly D0026 §7's hidden-history tomography.  This module
--        certifies the relational coordinate and says nothing about the
--        Set-valued one.
--
--    (c) §4.4's fence, restated so it is not lost in translation: the
--        four cells show sep and comp are LOGICALLY independent as
--        coordinates.  They do not show the coordinates are causally
--        unrelated in any given family; on families where every cut
--        state must meet both boundaries the cells can be constrained.
--        The theorem is that no such constraint is implied by the
--        definitions.
--
--    (d) Theorem 4 is elementary and is SEARCH-pending for prior art
--        (source note §4.6).  What the note claims as absent from this
--        corpus is the PAIRING — a probe defect and a gluing defect
--        carried as one two-coordinate object — not the table.
--
--   Nothing here is measured, fitted, or floating-point: the carrier has
--   two elements and every verdict is a kernel reduction.  This replaces
--   the legacy Python control of `OPERATIONAL_SITE_CRYSTAL` §6 in
--   `machinery/operational_site.py` (source note §4.5), which reports
--   the same phenomenon family for witness (i) and which under
--   CLAUDE.md is not proof.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, no TERMINATING, no primTrustMe.

-- §1  The relational cut system (Definition 4.1)

-- The glued realization: relational composition through Σ₁.  Over a

--
-- RENAMED, and the rename is the whole repair of a real breakage.  A
-- top-level `comp` at this position collides with `comp` from
-- `Cubical/Core/Primitives.agda:16`, which every `--cubical` module has
-- in scope, and the collision is FATAL, not shadowing:
--
--   container (Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 at /root/agda-libs/cubical):
--     GterTwoCoordinate.agda:205,1-5 "Multiple definitions of comp."
--     — reported by another lane in
--     `TheTwoPigeonholesAreInterderivable…OpenItem.agda` §0, which then
--     conjectured "under the declared pin it evidently does not fire."
--   pin (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9 @ b150186): IT FIRES THERE TOO, as a
--     name clash against the same primitive while scope-checking this
--     very signature.  So the conjecture was wrong, and the module was
--     red on BOTH toolchains, not one.
--
-- Nothing mathematical changes: the coordinate, the four witnesses and
-- the two independence theorems are untouched; only this identifier and
-- its three use sites move.  Everything.agda:432 imports this module,
-- so the clash was also the FIRST error of the whole aggregate.
