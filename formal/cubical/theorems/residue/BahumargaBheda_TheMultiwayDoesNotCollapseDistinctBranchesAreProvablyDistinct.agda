-- बहुमार्ग-भेद — the many paths are distinct: Wolfram's MULTIWAY
-- systems keep branching histories and refuse to collapse them.  Put to
-- the kernel: two computational branches with different winding are
-- PROVABLY unequal — the multiway does not collapse, as a theorem.
--
-- This is the checked witness of Wolfram's core multicomputational
-- principle (a branch is not identified with another branch, ever) — and
-- it is exactly why the corpus's proof-relevant e-graph KEEPS distinct
-- paths (CRYSTAL.md L2: "distinct automorphisms survive as distinct
-- paths").  In a set (an h-set) all paths collapse; the circle is NOT a
-- set, and winding is the invariant that tells the branches apart.
