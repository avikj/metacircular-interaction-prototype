--
-- THE GENERAL TOOLKIT OF THE ANEKĀNTA–UNIVALENCE DELTAS, as terms.
--
-- Delta 14 is a theorem factory: it lists results across sections A–O,
-- most of them standard, and asks for the exact ones to be made
-- executable in the machine core.  `CenterRelative` does
-- §A's specific object (T14.1–T14.2, C14.3, Program 14.71).  THIS file
-- does the parts of §§A, C, D, H that are about no particular object —
-- the reusable lemmas every later perspective comparison will consume.
--
-- Delta 14's own promotion criterion is quoted, because it governs what
-- is and is not below: *"The criterion for promotion is executable
-- comparison, not conceptual resemblance."*  Accordingly every numbered
-- item here is either a term or an explicit statement of why it is not.
--
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED, BY DELTA-14 NUMBER
--
--   §A  `restricts-suff`     T14.6, sufficient direction: if the two
--                            sector predicates correspond fibrewise
--                            along `e`, the equivalence restricts.
--       `restricts-nec`      T14.6, necessary direction, in the form
--                            that is actually true (see below).
--       `sector-not-inv`     C14.7: an inhabitant of `A₊ a` with `B₊ (e a)`
--                            uninhabited is exactly an obstruction to
--                            restriction — so ambient equivalence can
--                            fail after sector selection, and the reason
--                            is always non-invariance of the predicate.
--
--   §C  `conj-iterate`       T14.14: `(fᵉ)ⁿ = e ∘ fⁿ ∘ e⁻¹`, by induction.
--       `conj-fixed`         C14.15 for fixed points: `e` carries
--                            `Fix f` to `Fix fᵉ` as an equivalence.
--                            Periods follow from `conj-iterate` and are
--                            stated for period n as `conj-per`.
--
--   §D  `section→inhabited`  T14.21: a section makes every fibre
--                            inhabited …
--       `inhabited↛contr`    … and NOT contractible, with the witness
--                            `Bool` — an inhabited non-contractible
--                            fibre exists, so the implication genuinely
--                            fails rather than merely being unproved.
--       `constMonodromy`     P14.24: for the constant two-point family
--                            over ANY base, transport along ANY path is
--                            the identity.  So a two-point fibre alone
--                            carries no monodromy.
--       `twoPointNoObstr`    C14.25, stated as the contrapositive that
--                            is usable: exhibiting a two-element fibre
--                            does not exhibit an obstruction, because
--                            `B × Bool → B` has two-element fibres and
--                            trivial transport throughout.
--
--   §H  `restrict-fibre`     T14.44: a total-space map restricts to the
--                            fibre over `c₀` exactly when its base
--                            component fixes `c₀`.
--       `transport-back`     T14.45: and if the base component moves
--                            `c₀` to `c₁`, a path `c₁ ≡ c₀` returns the
--                            output to `G c₀` by transport.
--
--
-- WHY T14.6's "IFF" IS SPLIT AND NOT PROVED AS STATED
--
-- Delta 14 states T14.6 as an iff: *"e restricts to A₊ ≃ B₊ iff
-- A₊(a) ↔ B₊(e a) for all a"*.  Read literally in a proof-relevant
-- setting that is FALSE in the ← direction, and the file says so rather
-- than quietly weakening it.  A restriction `Σ A A₊ ≃ Σ B B₊` need not
-- arise from fibrewise maps at all: it may permute the base.  What IS
-- true, and is `restricts-nec` below, is the direction that gets used:
-- if the restriction is *over* `e` (i.e. its first component is `e`),
-- then the predicates correspond.  The unrestricted converse needs
-- either "over `e`" or a fibrewise hypothesis, and adding it silently
-- would be exactly Delta 14 §N's **P14.67 false-quotient danger** in
-- miniature.
--
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY
--
--  * **T14.19 and T14.22 are NOT re-proved.**  "q is an equivalence iff
--    every homotopy fibre is contractible" is `Cubical.Foundations.Equiv`'s
--    *definition* of `isEquiv` together with `isoToEquiv`/`equivToIso`;
--    "a path `b ≡ b'` induces `fib q b ≃ fib q b'`" is `subst` on the
--    fibre family.  Delta 14 labels both "Known" and they are one import
--    away.  Re-deriving them would be the rediscovery failure this
--    corpus has documented repeatedly.
--
--  * **No cost, no complexity, nothing from §L.**  `G(e;f) = C(f) − C(fᵉ)`
--    (D14.59) and the equivalence-optimised prediction cost (D14.61) are
--    *definitions requiring a cost model*, and this repository has no
--    checked cost model.  Delta 14 itself marks P14.65 "an operational
--    observation, not a canonical numerical theorem".  Writing a `Cost`
--    field here would be inventing the measurement `CLAUDE.md` forbids.
--
--  * **Nothing from §I (direction).**  P14.48 — that identity types
--    cannot faithfully represent irreversible reduction — is *correct
--    and is a reason not to write it here*: it calls for directed or
--    guarded type theory, which cubical v0.5 does not provide and which
--    `--safe` will not let us postulate.  Recorded as a real gap, not
--    papered over.
--
--  * **No claim that any of this is new.**  Every item is standard
--    homotopy type theory.  The contribution is that the machine core
--    now *has* them, so a later perspective comparison cites instead of
--    re-deriving — which is Delta 14 C14.64's point, and the only reason
--    a toolkit file is worth writing.

-- A.  BOUNDARY RESTRICTION  (T14.6, C14.7)
--
-- Delta 14's "boundary-breaking schema": given an equivalence and a

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- T14.6, sufficient direction.  Fibrewise correspondence of the sector
-- predicates gives the restricted equivalence.

restricts-suff e A₊ B₊ h = Σ-cong-equiv e h

-- T14.6, necessary direction, in the form that is true: a restriction

-- C14.7.  The obstruction to restriction, named as an object: a point of

--
-- Delta 14 §C: `fᵉ = e ∘ f ∘ e⁻¹`, and everything conjugacy-invariant

-- D.  FIBRES, SECTIONS, AND THE MONODROMY QUESTION
--     (T14.21, P14.24, C14.25)
--
-- This is the section of Delta 14 that lands directly on live work.
-- `SieveFiber` found that the sieve quotient DOES admit a
-- section while reconstruction fails, and that the residual is one bit.
-- T14.21 is the general form of the first half; C14.25 is the warning
-- attached to the second, and it is a warning this corpus needed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- T14.21.  A section makes every fibre inhabited.
section→inhabited :
  (q : A → B) (s : B → A) → ((b : B) → q (s b) ≡ b)
  → (b : B) → fiber q b
section→inhabited q s sect b = s b , sect b

-- … but NOT contractible, and here is the witness rather than the
-- assertion: the first projection `B × Bool → B` has a section, and its
-- fibre over any `b` contains two distinct points.
module TwoPointFibre {B : Type ℓ} (b : B) where

  pr : B × Bool → B
  pr = fst

  sec : B → B × Bool
  sec x = (x , true)

  sec-is-section : (x : B) → pr (sec x) ≡ x
  sec-is-section x = refl

  ptTrue ptFalse : fiber pr b
  ptTrue  = (b , true)  , refl
  ptFalse = (b , false) , refl

  -- The two fibre points are distinct, so the fibre is not a proposition
  -- and a fortiori not contractible.
  fibre-not-prop : isProp (fiber pr b) → ⊥
  fibre-not-prop hp =
    true≢false (cong (λ z → z .fst .snd) (hp ptTrue ptFalse))

-- P14.24.  For a CONSTANT family over any base, transport along any path
-- is the identity.  So "the fibre has two points" supplies no monodromy
-- whatsoever — the sheets are never exchanged.
constMonodromy :
  {B : Type ℓ} {C : Type ℓ'} {b b' : B} (p : b ≡ b') (x : C)
  → subst (λ _ → C) p x ≡ x
constMonodromy p x = transportRefl x

-- C14.25, in the form a lane can actually use.
--
-- **A residual bit is not an obstruction.**  If someone exhibits a
-- two-element fibre and calls it a binary obstruction, the above is the
-- counterexample: `B × Bool → B` has two-element fibres over every point,
-- admits a section, and has trivial transport along every loop.  What an
-- obstruction requires is that some loop ACT nontrivially on the fibre —
-- sheet exchange — and that is a strictly further fact which must be
-- exhibited separately.
--
-- Recorded as a type so that a lane claiming an obstruction has
-- something to inhabit.  `MonodromyOf F b p` says the loop `p` at `b`
-- acts non-identically on the family `F`.
MonodromyOf : {B : Type ℓ} (F : B → Type ℓ') (b : B) (p : b ≡ b) → Type _
MonodromyOf F b p = Σ[ x ∈ F b ] (subst F p x ≡ x → ⊥)

-- P14.24 / C14.25.  A CONSTANT two-sheet family over any base admits no
-- monodromy at all: every loop acts as the identity.  Together with the
-- module above — two distinct points in the fibre, and a section — this
-- is the counterexample in full: two-element fibres, a section, and
-- trivial transport along every loop.  So neither "the fibre has two
-- elements" nor "a section exists" is evidence of an obstruction.
--
-- SCOPE, and it is narrower than a first draft of this file claimed.
-- The statement is about the constant family `λ _ → Bool`, NOT about
-- `fiber pr`.  `fiber pr` is not constant — it varies over the base —
-- so `transportRefl` does not apply to it, and proving ITS monodromy
-- trivial needs the (true, but separate) fact that the bundle is
-- trivialisable naturally.  That is not proved here.  P14.24 as Delta 14
-- states it is the constant-family statement, and that is exactly what
-- is below; anything stronger would need the trivialisation.
--
-- **GAP CLOSED, and by a stronger route than the one this paragraph
-- proposed.**  `SetBaseNoMonodromy.setNoMonodromy` proves
-- it for EVERY family over a base that is a set — no trivialisation
-- needed, because over a 0-type `p ≡ refl` and there is no loop to act.
-- So the constant-family restriction below is not the general statement;
-- it is the special case that happens to need no hypothesis on the base.
-- Cite that module, not this one, when the base is known to be a set.
constNoMonodromy :
  {B : Type ℓ} (C : Type ℓ') (b : B) (p : b ≡ b)
  → MonodromyOf {B = B} (λ _ → C) b p → ⊥
constNoMonodromy C b p (x , nontrivial) = nontrivial (transportRefl x)

-- The two-sheet instance, named so a lane can cite it directly.
twoSheetNoObstr :

-- H.  GRADED / DEPENDENT CHARGE  (T14.44, T14.45, C14.46)
--
-- Delta 14 §H: charge as a dependent index `G : C → U`, the

-- fibre.  When does a transformation of the total space restrict to a
-- sector?
