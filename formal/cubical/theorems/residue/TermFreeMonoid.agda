--
-- THE CHART TRANSITION FOR THE GENERATIVE LANE.
--
-- `Obstruction` defines
--
--     data Tm : Type₀ where
--       var  : Tm
--       node : Shape → Tm → Tm
--
--     plug : Tm → Tm → Tm
--     plug var        u = u
--     plug (node c t) u = node c (plug t u)
--
-- which is `List Shape` with `_++_`, constructor for constructor.  That
-- observation is the beginning of the work here, not the end of it.
--
-- The reading to avoid — and it was this repository's reading until
-- 2026-08-14 — is "so the lane is 1400 lines of nothing, delete it".
-- That is backwards, and `AtlasResiduals` is the module
-- that says why: a presentation is a CHART, and an atlas is charts
-- together with the transitions between them.  Two presentations with a
-- transition are strictly more than one presentation.  What was missing
-- was never the second chart; it was this file.
--
-- So nothing below deletes anything.  It connects, and then collects
-- what the connection pays for.
--
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED
--
--   §1  `TmChart`            Iso Tm (List Shape), both round trips by
--       `Tm≃List`            induction; and `toList-plug`, saying the
--       `toList-plug`        chart carries `plug` to `_++_`.  The
--                            transition is a monoid map, which is the
--                            only reason transporting along it is
--                            worth anything.
--
--   §2  `plug-assoc`         (Tm, plug, var) is a MONOID.  Associativity
--       `plug-unit-l`        was not previously stated anywhere in the
--       `plug-unit-r`        lane — the lane had a binary operation and
--                            no law about it — so this is new, and it is
--                            `++-assoc` read through §1.
--
--   §3  `rec`                THE UNIVERSAL PROPERTY, in initial-algebra
--       `rec-unique`         form: for every `e : M` and `f : Shape → M`
--       `rec-hom`            and `_·_`, the function determined by
--       `rec-η`              `var ↦ e`, `node c t ↦ f c · rec t` EXISTS
--                            and is UNIQUE among functions satisfying
--                            those two equations; and if `_·_` is
--                            associative with `e` a unit, that function
--                            is a monoid homomorphism `(Tm, plug, var) →
--                            (M, ·, e)` extending `f` along
--                            `η c = node c var`.  Hence (Tm, plug, var)
--                            is the FREE MONOID on Shape.
--
--                            NO h-LEVEL HYPOTHESIS ANYWHERE.  Uniqueness
--                            is pointwise, proved by induction against
--                            the two equations as paths, so `M` need not
--                            be a set.  (This file was written the day
--                            `AtlasResiduals` had exactly such an
--                            unnecessary set hypothesis removed; the
--                            lesson is applied rather than restated.)
--
--   §4  `size-is-rec`        THE PAYOFF.  The lane's two hand-proved
--       `deficit-is-rec`     additivity lemmas are one theorem.
--       `plug-size′`         `WitnessPolicy.size` is the extension of
--       `plug-deficit′`      `λ _ → 1`, and `GenerativeLoop.deficit V`
--       `rec-additive`       is the extension of `delta V`, both into
--                            (ℕ, +, 0) — each identification is `refl`
--                            at both equations, so `rec-unique` closes
--                            them immediately.  Their additivity over
--                            `plug` is then not a coincidence checked
--                            twice by induction but a single instance of
--                            `rec-hom`, and `rec-additive` states the
--                            general fact: EVERY measure defined by this
--                            recursion into a monoid is automatically
--                            plug-additive.
--
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY
--
--  * Not that `WitnessPolicy.plug-size` or `ProgressDefinition.
--    `plug-deficit` are wrong, or should be removed.  They are correct
--    and they are three lines each.  What §4 adds is the reason they
--    hold, which is a property of the recursion scheme and not of `size`
--    or `deficit`; the primed versions are re-derivations THROUGH the
--    universal property, offered as the transition, not as replacements.
--
--  * Not that the free monoid is new mathematics.  It is not, by a very
--    long way.  What is new is that this lane's `Tm` is now connected to
--    it, so the lane inherits statements instead of re-proving them.
--
--  * Not an upstreamable free-monoid module.  Worth recording, though,
--    since the ecosystem survey went looking: cubical v0.5 has
--    `HITs/FreeComMonoids`, `HITs/FreeGroup`, `HITs/FreeAbGroup` and
--    `Algebra/CommMonoid/Instances/FreeComMonoid`, and NO universal
--    property for the free MONOID on a type — `Data/List/Properties`
--    has `++-assoc` and `++-unit-r` but nothing characterising `List`.
--    The gap is real; filling it upstream is a separate job from this
--    one, and this file does not do it (it is stated for `Tm`, not for a
--    general `List A`).
--
--  * `Shape = ℕ` here, as everywhere in the lane.  Nothing below uses
--    that, and nothing below uses decidable equality on Shape; the
--    development would go through verbatim for an arbitrary Shape type.

-- 4.  What the connection pays for.
--
-- `size` and `deficit V` are both defined in the lane by exactly the
-- recursion of §3 into (ℕ, +, 0), and each was separately proved
-- additive over `plug` by its own induction.  Below, each is identified
-- with its recursor — both equations hold by `refl`, so `rec-unique`
-- closes the identification on the spot — and additivity then falls out
-- of `rec-hom` once, for both, and for anything else defined this way.
