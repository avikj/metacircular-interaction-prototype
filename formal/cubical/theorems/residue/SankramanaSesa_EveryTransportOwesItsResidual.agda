-- SankramanaSesa — संक्रमणम् सशेषम् ।
-- (transport, with its remainder: the transport layer of the machine.)
--
-- संक्रमणम्, न प्रतिलिपिः — transported, not copied.
--
-- THE OBJECT.  When a result moves between representations — a derivation
-- from the Haskell runtime to the Agda core, a form between two
-- vocabularies, a rule set between two presentations — three moves are
-- conceivable and only two exist:
--
--   1. move it along an explicit identification.  Nothing is dropped and
--      nothing is re-described: `संक्रमणम् e = transport (ua e)`, and
--      `अलोपः = uaβ` says the transported value is the equivalence's value
--      on the nose.  The original is not duplicated; it is gone from the
--      source coordinates and present in the target's.
--   2. move it along a map that is NOT an identification, and carry what
--      the target forgets.  §2: the residual over a target point b is
--      exactly `fiber r b`, and `सशेषम्` proves the source is the target
--      paired with its residual, with no slack.
--   3. copy the unknown.  §4: this does not exist.  `∥_∥₁` is the
--      destroying operation (`squash₁` equates every inhabitant); it has
--      no section at `Bool`, so what it forgets is not recoverable and
--      `∣_∣₁` is not an equivalence.  The prohibition is a theorem, not a
--      policy laid over one.
--
-- A transport reporting no loss is reporting that nobody looked, UNLESS
-- it exhibits the contraction: `अलोप-लक्षणम्` (§2) says loss-free is
-- precisely "every residual is contractible", which is `isEquiv`'s own
-- definition in this substrate.  So "no residual" is a claim with a proof
-- obligation attached, and the obligation is stated in the same breath.
--
-- WHICH SCHOOL, SAID AT THE SITE, because the two readings of this same
-- holds both without blending them.  Read from Madhyamaka (Nāgārjuna,
-- *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* 24.18; *Vigrahavyāvartanī* 29), univalence is
-- niḥsvabhāva: a type has no own-being over its equivalences, and the
-- identification empties the distinction between the two representations.
-- Read from the Jaina side (Umāsvāti, *Tattvārthasūtra*; Siddhasena
-- Divākara, *Sanmatitarka*), the same `ua` is anekānta held by pramāṇa:
-- two nayas, both retained, joined by a bridge that carries and drops
-- nothing.  These schools refute each other — Jaina logicians reject the
-- emptying, Madhyamikas reject a many-natured object — and the dispute is
-- content, not noise.
--
-- **The machine takes the retentive branch, and here is why, at the site.**
-- A transport layer whose job is to name what the target forgets needs the
-- residual to be an OBJECT it can hold, store, and hand back.  On the
-- emptying reading the residual has no own-being to record either, and the
-- honest statement of a lossy boundary — "this much did not cross, and
-- here it is" — has nothing to be about.  §2 requires `शेष` to be a type
-- with inhabitants that get carried; §6 requires the residual family to
-- resist being summarised.  That is anekānta's retention, not śūnyatā's
-- emptying.  The Madhyamaka reading is not refuted by this file and is not
-- being used by it.
--
-- §6 is where the two named modules meet.  `Anekanta`
-- proves plurality-blocks-collapse: where standpoints disagree there is NO
-- single object equivalent to every fiber.  Applied to a residual family:
-- when a boundary forgets different amounts over different target points,
-- **the loss cannot be summarised by one object at all** — "the residual"
-- as a single thing does not exist, and the record must stay pointwise.
-- `LosslessReturn` supplies the machine's proved-lossless boundary,
-- `(ℕ × ℕ) ≃ विवेक`, whose residual §5b computes to be contractible
-- everywhere — a "no loss" report that did look.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No source of this repository states a fibration
-- theorem; the Sanskrit here names the operations (संक्रमण, passage/transit;
-- शेष, remainder — Āryabhaṭa's *Āryabhaṭīya* 499, kuṭṭaka, is where "keep
-- the remainder and recurse on it" is the working rule), and the
-- mathematics is HoTT Lemma 4.8.2 and univalence.  Naming the module for
-- शेष does not say Āryabhaṭa proved it.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0, cubical library as installed by the container.
-- --cubical --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- 1.  संक्रमणम् — the move that exists, along an explicit identification.
--
-- The identification is `ua e`: not "these look alike", but the
-- equivalence itself, entered as a path.  अलोपः (non-erasure) says the
-- transported value is `equivFun e a` exactly — nothing is re-described on
-- the way.  प्रत्यागमनम् says the passage is reversible: the source value is
-- recoverable from the target one.  Together: the state moved, and it
-- moved whole.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

संक्रमणम् : {A B : Type ℓ} → A ≃ B → A → B
संक्रमणम् e = transport (ua e)

अलोपः : {A B : Type ℓ} (e : A ≃ B) (a : A) → संक्रमणम् e a ≡ equivFun e a

-- 2.  शेष — the residual, and the theorem that every map owes one.
--
-- Given ANY representation change r : A → B, the exact thing B forgets at
-- a target point b is the type of source points r sends to b, with the
-- witness.  That is `fiber r b`, and it is not a metaphor for the loss:
-- सशेषम् proves the source is the target paired with it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

शेष {A = A} r b = Σ[ a ∈ A ] (r a ≡ b)

सशेषम् : (r : A → B) → A ≃ (Σ[ b ∈ B ] शेष r b)
सशेषम् r = totalEquiv r

-- अलोप-लक्षणम् — the mark of a genuinely loss-free boundary.  "Reports no
-- loss" is exactly "every residual is contractible": the residual is a
-- single point and its being so is proved, not assumed.  Both directions,
-- because a no-loss claim must be checkable and a proved identification
-- must be allowed to make it.

-- over one target point and are NOT identified, the boundary is lossy, and
-- no amount of wanting makes it a transport.

-- 3.  शेष-सङ्घातः — residuals compose; nothing vanishes between stages.
--
-- A result crossing two boundaries (runtime → core → vocabulary) has one
-- residual per stage, and the residual of the composite is exactly the two
-- of them stacked.  So a chain of transports loses nothing that no single
-- stage lost: the loss is accounted stage by stage, and the total is the
-- pair, not a summary of the pair.

-- 4.  न प्रतिलिपिः — the third move does not exist.
--
-- `∥_∥₁` is the operation that destroys: `squash₁` makes every inhabitant
-- equal, so the truncation of `Bool` remembers that something was there
-- and not which.  It has NO section — no map back returning what went in —
-- and therefore `∣_∣₁` is not an equivalence and the loss is not
-- recoverable by any later cleverness.  The proof is the whole
-- prohibition: a would-be section must agree on `∣ false ∣₁` and
-- `∣ true ∣₁`, because those are equal, and then `false ≡ true`.

-- 5.  The machine-facing interface: a transport that carries its residual.
--
-- A boundary in the machine is not "a function between representations".
-- It is a function TOGETHER WITH the type of what the target forgets, and
-- a proof that the two together reconstitute the source.  The canonical
-- constructor supplies `fiber` — so "I did not look" is not expressible as
-- an instance.

-- 5b. The machine's proved-lossless boundary, and its residual.
--
-- `LosslessReturn` proves the pair of magnitudes and the descent-record are
-- equivalent both ways.  Read as a boundary: the residual over every
-- विवेक is contractible — exactly one (ℕ × ℕ) sits over it, and that is a
-- fact, not an absence of inspection.  This is what a "no residual" report
-- costs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6.  The residual may have no summary — Anekānta applied to a boundary.
--
-- Take a boundary that forgets unevenly: `Unit → Bool` hitting only
-- `true`.  Over `true` the residual is inhabited; over `false` it is
-- empty.  So the residual family is स्यादस्ति and स्यान्नास्ति together, and by
-- `plurality-blocks-collapse` NO type Q is equivalent to every residual.
--
-- The consequence for the transport layer: a lossy boundary does not in
-- general have "a residual" — a single object naming what it forgets.  It
-- has a residual AT EACH TARGET POINT, and replacing the family by one
-- summary object is not merely lossy, it is unavailable.  The permitted
-- moves stay the two Anekanta names: transport along an identification, or
-- keep the family.
