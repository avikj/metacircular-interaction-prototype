-- TheStratificationTerminatesOnItsOwnLength
--
-- With the measure of `TheRemainderIsStrictlyShorterSoTheStratificationHasAMeasure`
-- in hand the recursion is four lines and its termination is one
-- induction.  The LAYER properties are in the modules cited at the end.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--
--   leftover / strata     the fuelled iteration: peel the maximal
--                         layer, recurse on the remainder
--   lengthZeroGivesNil    a list of length ≤ 0 is empty
--   fuelSuffices          if the fuel is at least the length, the
--                         iteration exhausts the archive
--   theStratificationTerminates
--                         hence `leftover (lengthL xs) xs ≡ []` — the
--                         archive's OWN LENGTH is enough fuel
--
-- The induction is that measure applied once per step:
-- `theRemainderIsStrictlyShorter` turns `lengthL (x ∷ xs) ≤ suc n` into
-- `lengthL (remainder (x ∷ xs)) ≤ n`, which is exactly the recursive
-- call's obligation.  Nothing else is needed.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- NO NOVELTY.  Fuelled recursion with the fuel bounded by a decreasing
-- measure is the standard way to write a well-founded loop without
-- well-founded machinery.

-- One step is the right unit here, because `strata` peels a layer and
-- recurses on EXACTLY the complement these two are about.  Both are
-- proved for an arbitrary decidable predicate and instantiated once —
-- nothing about Pareto maximality is used, only that the two filters
-- are complementary, which is why each is three lines.
