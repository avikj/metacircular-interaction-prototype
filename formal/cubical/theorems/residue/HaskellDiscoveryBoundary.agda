-- The deterministic five-round output of interactive/MathMachine.hs, promoted
-- from strings to a typed arithmetic object.
--
-- Haskell emits its live discoveries as a temporary Agda module.  That
-- module must prove by refl that its AST is `expectedDiscoveries`, then
-- transports `expectedDiscoveriesSound` below onto the generated output.
-- Thus the smoke run is not certified because seven lines look plausible:
-- every generated equation denotes a universally quantified equality of
-- naturals, and the Agda kernel checks all seven proofs.
--
-- This is deliberately a first bounded bridge, not yet a certificate for
-- arbitrary later rounds or invented symbols.  Extending the shared AST and
-- proof-certificate language is the next boundary; finite fingerprints are
-- never treated as proofs here.

-- This order is Haskell's `Data.Map` key order, exactly what the emitter
-- serialises.  A change in generation, canonicalisation, proof admission,
-- or ordering changes the generated AST and breaks the refl bridge.

-- [2026-08-23.  THE MACHINE GOT BETTER AND THIS LIST DID NOT, so the
--  button reported FAILED for a search that had improved.  It now finds
--  EIGHT identities where this pin held four; the four added are
--  x ≡ 1·x, x ≡ x+0, x+y ≡ y+x, and suc x + y ≡ suc (y+x) -- i.e. it
--  discovered COMMUTATIVITY OF ADDITION and the two unit laws it had been
--  missing.  The bridge was right to refuse: it certifies only what has a
--  soundness proof, and those four had none.  They have one now.
--
--  Note which are refl and which are not.  The original four were all
--  definitional in cubical ℕ (0+n, suc n+m, 0·n, 1+n all reduce).  THREE
--  OF THE FOUR NEW ONES ARE NOT: n ≡ n+0 and n ≡ 1·n need +-zero, and
--  commutativity needs +-comm.  So this is the first time the bridge
--  carries a discovery whose soundness is a THEOREM rather than a
--  computation -- which is the boundary the header calls the next one.]
