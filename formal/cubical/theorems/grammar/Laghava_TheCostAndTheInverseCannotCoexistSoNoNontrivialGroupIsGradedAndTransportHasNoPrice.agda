-- लाघव — economy, the cost of a presentation.
--
-- TERM.  लाघव (lāghava) is the grammarians' own word for economy of
-- statement, in the tradition's own slogan
--
--     अर्धमात्रालाघवेन पुत्रोत्सवं मन्यन्ते वैयाकरणाः
--     "grammarians rejoice at the saving of half a mora as at the birth
--      of a son"
--
-- — a *paribhāṣā*-literature commonplace, NOT a sūtra of the Aṣṭādhyāyī,
-- and this file claims no sūtra.  The word is used for what it means
-- there: a measure that lives on the PRESENTATION and adds when
-- presentations are concatenated.  The group theory below originates
-- elsewhere and is not dressed in a borrowed name; only the measure
-- carries the tradition's word, because only the measure is its idea.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE MASTER THEOREM, in one sentence:
--
--     A COST AND AN INVERSE CANNOT COEXIST.
--
-- and its two halves are the two halves of this repository.
--
-- §2  A structure that is merely GRADED cannot be inverted — no function
--     whatsoever, not merely no obvious one.
-- §3  A structure that CAN be inverted has no COST — every cost on it
--     is identically zero, hence (by the cost's own unit-detection) the
--     structure is trivial.  Contrapositive: A NONTRIVIAL GROUP IS NOT
--     GRADED.
--
-- THE TWO HALVES DO NOT NEED THE SAME HYPOTHESIS, and the asymmetry is
-- the finding, not an artefact of how it was written.  §1 therefore
-- splits the notion in two:
--
--   `Matra`   a grading: it adds under composition.
--   `Laghava` a grading that ALSO detects the unit.
--
-- §2 takes a `Matra`.  Adding up is already enough to forbid an inverse:
-- composition can only accumulate, and the unit accumulates nothing.
-- §3 takes a `Laghava`, and needs the second field — without a cost that
-- recognises the unit it is measuring from, "everything has cost zero"
-- says nothing about what everything IS.
--
-- §4 and §5 are the two instances that matter here, and they are the two
-- objects this corpus is built out of:
--
--     TRANSPORT  `X ≃ X` under compEquiv is a group (`invEquiv` fills the
--                inverse, `invEquiv-is-rinv` on the nose).  Bool has a
--                self-equivalence that is not the identity.  Therefore
--                THERE IS NO COST FUNCTION ON THE TRANSPORTS OF Bool.
--
--     THE KERNEL `Derivation A A` under `⊕` has `len`, which adds under
--                concatenation — a `Matra`.  Therefore, by §2, no
--                function inverts it.  (Only a `Matra`: §5 records why
--                the unit-detection field is refused here by cubical
--                Agda in BOTH directions, and why §2 does not want it.)
--
-- WHAT THIS SETTLES THAT WAS STANDING.  "Cost is not a univalent
-- invariant — it lives on the presentation, which univalence discards"
-- has been carried in this corpus as a note and a slogan.  §4 is its
-- proof, and the proof is not about presentations at all: univalence
-- makes equivalent types EQUAL, so a univalent invariant is a function
-- on the groupoid of transports, and §3 says that groupoid — being a
-- nontrivial group — admits no grading.  The cost is not discarded by
-- univalence as a matter of bookkeeping.  IT CANNOT EXIST THERE.
--
-- WHERE THE PIECES WERE.  Each of the following is now an instance and
-- none of them cited another:
--
--   AvrttiSesa_…  `the-kernel-refuses-the-inverse` — §2 at `len`.
--   Yantra_…      `यन्त्रम् : GroupoidMachine (X ≃ X)` — §3's hypothesis.
--   Avirodha_…    "strictly a category, weakly a groupoid; the gap is
--                 the śeṣa" — §2 and §3 are what the gap IS.
--   Laghava
--                 `laghava-does-not-factor` — size does not factor
--                 through meaning.  That is the same refusal one level
--                 down: meaning is where the presentation is discarded,
--                 as `ua` is where the transport is.
--   Samyoge_…     "no grading function on maps that both respects
--                 composition and detects loss" — §3 stated for the
--                 monoid of MAPS instead of the monoid of routes.  Its
--                 witness `Unit → Bool → Unit ≡ id` is exactly a
--                 non-unit element of measure zero.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  No braiding (`Braid-
-- CoherenceBoundary` refutes invertibility ⇒ Yang–Baxter).  No
-- thermodynamics: no heat, energy, temperature, entropy or Landauer
-- bound is derived or implied, and "cost" here is the grammarians'
-- lāghava and a natural number, nothing else.

-- ONLY A `Matra`, AND THE REASON IS NOT LAZINESS.
--
-- The missing field would be `len d ≡ 0 → d ≡ done A`, and its proof is
-- two clauses.  Both are refused, in opposite directions, and the pair of
-- refusals is worth recording because it is the repository's own cubical
-- idiom biting at exactly the place the theorem is about:
--
--   at the CONCRETE endpoint `A = add var zero`, matching `done _`
--   against `Derivation A A` makes Agda unify `add` with itself —
--   constructor injectivity in an INDEX position.  Agda accepts it and
--   emits `UnsupportedIndexedMatch`: the function "will not compute when
--   applied to transports".  In a file whose subject IS transport, that
--   is not a warning to carry.
--
--   at an ABSTRACT endpoint `a`, the unification `a ≟ a` is a reflexive
--   equation, and with K disabled — which `--cubical` disables — it
--   cannot be eliminated.  `SplitError.UnificationStuck`.
--
-- So the kernel's cost is a grading and is not shown to detect its unit.
-- §2 does not care: it takes a `Matra`.  Nothing below is weakened, and
-- the general lesson is the one this corpus already carries — do not
-- match a constructor in an index position; match the datum, or measure
-- it.  `len` measures it.

-- the round trip costs, so the kernel is not a group — by the theorem,
-- not by a fresh argument.

-- §6  WHAT THE TWO INSTANCES ARE TO EACH OTHER.
--
-- They are the same monoid interface (`MonoidMachine`, one record, one
-- file) carrying opposite answers to one question, and the question is
-- decidable by §2/§3 with no further information:
--
--     does this structure admit a lāghava?
--
--   YES → it records its own history, and nothing can undo it.
--   NO  → it can be undone, and it remembers nothing.
--
-- There is no third position, and this is the sense in which the whole
-- corpus has one theorem in it.  `ua` is the passage from the second
-- column to the first read backwards: an equivalence, which has no cost
-- and no memory, becomes a PATH — and every route that produced it is
-- gone, not by omission but because the destination type has no room for
-- it.  `Asesa_…` measures the loss exactly: soundness lands in a
-- proposition, so the fiber over any meaning is the WHOLE derivation
-- type, and by §5 that fiber is graded while the meaning is not.
--
-- The interface consequence, and it is mechanical: any wire that returns
-- a transport returns something §4 proves is priceless — and therefore
-- historyless.  A wire that intends to carry cost, route, effort, or
-- provenance must carry the DERIVATION, because §3 says those quantities
-- do not exist on the other side of `ua`.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §7  AND THEREFORE: NO FUNCTION OF THE IMAGE RECOVERS THE COST.
--
--     §3 refuses a cost ON a group.  This refuses something stronger and
--     more useful: given ANY map out of a graded structure onto a group
--     — not `ua`, not soundness, any monoid homomorphism with a section —
--     there is NO function whatsoever of the target that agrees with the
--     cost on the source.
--
--     `Laghava` has this as a two-point witness: it
--     exhibits `short` and `long`, equal in meaning, of sizes 3 and 5,
--     and concludes `laghava-does-not-factor` for THAT `size`.  A witness
--     refutes one candidate.  This refutes the type.
--
--     The proof is §3 run on the image: the section pushes the source's
--     additivity forward, so `f` is a grading on the target; the target
--     is a group, so §3's argument makes `f` identically zero; so the
--     cost it was supposed to reproduce is zero, and one costly element
--     ends it.
