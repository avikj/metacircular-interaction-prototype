-- शरीरस्तरः — the count stratum of the heartbeat is provably blind to
-- the body's law of succession.
--
-- TERM.  शरीर (body) is the corpus's own word for the machine's
-- operative body (जीव's heartbeat reports on it); स्तर (stratum, layer)
-- is the word the ArpanaSopana lane already uses for truncation
-- levels.  The compound शरीर-स्तर, "body-stratum", is built HERE and no
-- source is claimed for it (CLAUDE.md, naming rule, note 2).
--
-- SEED.  The owner's transmission of 2026-08-23, term 4: the current
-- five-number heartbeat (nodes, edges, priced, unpriced, components)
-- is a projection of P₀ and part of P₁ of the body's Postnikov tower;
-- `mismatch = NONE` at the count stratum establishes only that the
-- count projection matched, NOT identity of the body.  The corrected
-- heartbeat must sense, per stratum: carrier persisted / law changed /
-- route acquired holonomy / higher coherence filled / new receptor
-- separated an old blind pair.
--
-- THIS MODULE IS THE FIRST STONE OF THAT, AS A TERM: it proves the
-- transmitted sentence "the count projection matching does not
-- establish identity" — not about graphs in general, but in the
-- sharpest available form, using the same succession pair that
-- KramaNiyama landed.  Two BODIES are exhibited: the same carrier,
-- the same counts at every P₀-grade a count-stratum heartbeat can
-- read (both are ℤ × ℤ with one binary operation — every cardinality
-- and arity datum agrees), differing only in the law of succession.
-- The count-stratum observation is blind on the pair; the succession
-- receptor separates it; QuotientFiberLaw's `collision-obstructs`
-- closes the box: NO post-processing of count-stratum readings
-- reconstructs the law stratum.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE FOR THE ORGANS, stated so the next carrier can wire it:
-- जीव's JIVA-HEARTBEAT line and चक्र's delta are count-stratum
-- observations in exactly this sense.  This module is the checked
-- license for extending them with a law-stratum line, and the checked
-- refutation of ever reading "counts matched" as "body unchanged".
-- The Haskell-side extension (a शरीरस्तर line in the heartbeat) is
-- engineering owed downstream; nothing here claims it exists.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Not a formalization of Postnikov towers (the
-- library's HITs lane holds the real ones); not a claim about the
-- jiva graph's actual π₁ — the two bodies here are the canonical
-- blind pair, imported from KramaNiyama, playing the role of two
-- states of a body between two heartbeats.  The k-invariant and
-- higher-coherence strata of term 4 remain open above this stone.
