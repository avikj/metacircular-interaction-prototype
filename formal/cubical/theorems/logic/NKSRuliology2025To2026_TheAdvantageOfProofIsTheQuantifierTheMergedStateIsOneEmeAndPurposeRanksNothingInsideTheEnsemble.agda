--
-- The 2025–2026 ruliology corpus, held to terms.  This module continues
-- NKSUnivalence_* over the SAME multiway system (two updating events on
-- unary strings) and answers three sentences from Wolfram's 2025–2026
-- writings, each quoted verbatim:
--
--   W5. "We don't get any fundamental advantage by trying to make a
--       proof rather than just running the Turing machine — in both
--       cases we have to expend a potentially unbounded amount of
--       computational effort."
--       (Towards a Theory of Bugs: The Ruliology of the Unexpected,
--        July 2026)
--   W6. "Equivalent states are in fact merged."  And the emes: "atoms
--       of existence" whose "only property is distinctness".
--       (What Ultimately Is There? Metaphysics and the Ruliad,
--        February 2026)
--   W7. The rulial ensemble is "an ensemble of possible rules ...
--       selected to 'achieve the purpose'", and life is patches of
--       irreducibility "fitted together to achieve that purpose"
--       through bulk orchestration.
--       (What's Special about Life?, November 2025)
--
-- W5: THE ADVANTAGE OF PROOF IS THE QUANTIFIER (§१).  The sentence is
-- exactly right about each single instance and exactly wrong about
-- their totality, and both halves are terms.  Running the system
-- reaches one endpoint per run; the term `sarva-prapti` reaches EVERY
-- endpoint at once — a function (n : ℕ) → Evolve zero n, built by one
-- induction through the snoc lemma — and no amount of running produces
-- a universally quantified statement, because a run is one point of
-- the family and the term is the family.  The corpus already holds the
-- machine-scale form (abstract 25: the composition theorem certifies
-- incr ⨟ incr for every n with no induction over the compound); this
-- is the same fact at the smallest scale, stated against W5's exact
-- sentence: the effort of proof is bounded by the induction, the
-- effort of running is unbounded over the family, and that asymmetry
-- IS the fundamental advantage.
--
-- W6: THE MERGED STATE IS ONE EME (§२).  NKSUnivalence_* merged the
-- branches with a propositional truncation — existence kept, identity
-- withheld.  Wolfram's February 2026 sentence is stronger: merged IN
-- THE OBJECT.  That is the set quotient, and it is also checked: under
-- the co-terminality relation, the branches become EQUAL as data
-- (`ekibhava`, by eq/), the whole quotient contracts to a single point
-- (`eka-eme`) — an object with no property but its own distinctness,
-- which is Wolfram's eme, constructed rather than posited — and the
-- stronger merge still has no section (`punaruddhara-nasti-eva`): the
-- collision that refuted reconstruction from the thread refutes it
-- from the quotient, by the same two congs.  So the two merges the
-- 2021 and 2026 sentences name — treat-as-equivalent and
-- merged-in-fact — are BOTH real, both lossy, and the loss is the same
-- computed object either way.
--
-- W7: PURPOSE RANKS NOTHING INSIDE THE ENSEMBLE (§३).  Take the
-- purpose to be arrival — reach state 3 from state 0 — so that the
-- ensemble "selected to achieve the purpose" is exactly the fibre of
-- the endpoint, populated here by the two interchanged orders.  Any
-- assessor that reads only purpose-achievement — any function out of
-- the merged outcome, prop-valued fitness included — answers equally
-- on all ensemble members (`niyojana-anankana`, the quotient form of
-- NKSUnivalence's baddha-drashta): selection BY the purpose cannot
-- rank WITHIN the ensemble that achieves it, which is abstract 12's
-- theorem (no scoring function of the outcome ranks the route) arrived
-- at from Wolfram's November 2025 vocabulary.  The orchestration half
-- of W7 — the step whose visible part consults its hidden part, the
-- checkable ingredient of "patches fitted together" — is already a
-- checked term as Jiva_*'s living step, cited not re-proved.
--
-- RELATION TO THE CORPUS, checked before writing.  Abstract 25's
-- composition theorem is W5 at machine scale; abstract 12 is W7's
-- non-ranking in general; Jiva_* holds W7's orchestration ingredient;
-- NKSUnivalence_* holds the truncation half of W6 and the branch pair
-- this module's quotient merges.  The set-quotient construction
-- parallels abstract 25's Beh = Code/SameRun, one level down: there
-- codes were quotiented by behaviour, here runs are quotiented by
-- co-terminality, and in both the quotient is the observer's object
-- while the fibre is the ruliology.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0 + agda/cubical v0.9 — the repository pin.
-- --cubical --guardedness --safe, no postulates, no holes, exit 0.
