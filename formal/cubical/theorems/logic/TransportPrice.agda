-- TransportPrice
--
-- The live thread `Anekanta` left open: collapse is settled (agreement
-- permits it, plurality blocks it), so the only question remaining about
-- two nayas is what a transport between them COSTS.
--
-- It has an answer, and the answer is that the question is smaller than
-- it looks.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE THEOREM
--
-- Suppose a cost `c p q` on transports, subject only to the one thing any
-- cost must satisfy — that going by way of a third standpoint costs the
-- sum:
--
--     c p q + c q r ≡ c p r.
--
-- Then, fixing any base standpoint b,
--
--     cocycle→coboundary :  c p q ≡ c b q − c b p.
--
-- **Every additive transport price is the difference of a potential.**
-- There is no path-dependence to discover, no cheapest route between two
-- standpoints, no holonomy around a loop (`loop-is-free`).  All the
-- content is in the potential — a number attached to each standpoint on
-- its own — and choosing well means choosing an endpoint, never a route.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THE POTENTIAL IS
--
-- `Laghava` supplies it and also says what it cannot be:
--
--   * `size` is a potential: the price of a reformulation is the change
--     in लाघव (`laghava-price` below);
--   * `laghava-is-not-semantic` proves no function of the DENOTATION
--     computes `size`.
--
-- Together: the price of a transport between two nayas is real, is
-- path-independent, and is invisible to every semantic invariant — so a
-- corpus that checks only denotations has no access to it at all, while
-- a grammarian working on presentations has complete access.  That is the
-- whole of Pāṇini's lāghava discipline, in two theorems.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- AND WHY "PRICE" IS THE WRONG WORD FOR IT — recorded, owner 2026-08-18
--
-- The potential is not a fee anyone pays.  It is a coordinate on
-- presentations, and "the price of getting from p to q" is nothing but
-- the difference of two coordinates.  Nothing is spent; a reformulation
-- gains what the difference says and loses nothing, because by
-- `Apavada.Reformulation` the denotation is untouched.  The scarcity
-- reading of this quantity was withdrawn in
-- `notes/THE_BARRIER_BELONGS_TO_THE_LINE.md` §24 and is withdrawn here
-- too; the name `TransportPrice` is kept only because the thread that
-- asked the question used it, and `loop-is-free` is the theorem that
-- makes the objection precise.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  That additivity is the right axiom for every
-- notion of cost — a cost that is not additive over intermediate
-- standpoints is outside this theorem, and the theorem is exactly the
-- statement that additivity alone already forces triviality of the path
-- structure.  Nor is any particular potential singled out: `size` is one,
-- and `Laghava` says node-count is not Pāṇini's own measure.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.

-- 3.  The answer to the thread, stated once.
--
-- What does a transport between two nayas cost?  Whatever the potential
-- says, and nothing else.  Additivity alone kills every path structure:
-- no route matters, no loop accumulates, and the reverse is the negation.
-- The question "what is the price of this transport" is therefore not a
-- question about the transport at all — it is a question about the two
-- endpoints, asked in a roundabout way.
--
-- And by `Laghava.laghava-is-not-semantic`, the potential this corpus
-- actually cares about is not a function of the denotation.  So the
-- quantity is real, is entirely determined by where you are rather than
-- how you came, and is invisible to every check this repository performs.
