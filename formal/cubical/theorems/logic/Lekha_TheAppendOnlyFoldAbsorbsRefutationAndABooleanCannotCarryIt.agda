-- लेखा — the ledger's fold.  (lekhā, "account/ledger": the term is the
-- repository's own — जीवो लेखा-धरः, saṃrakṣaṇa-sūtra २१ — chosen over a
-- Nyāya attribution DELIBERATELY, see the provenance fence below.)
--
-- organism and mapped it onto the Vaiśeṣika fourfold of absence.  A
-- later audit STRUCK that mapping — "these four struck equations were
-- modern constructions, not consequences of the fourfold … the four
-- operational behaviours remain potentially useful as an independently
-- specified event algebra, but their names no longer provide evidence
-- for it.  Proof, refutation, scoped no-go, and separation must be
-- typed from the repository's own evidentiary semantics."
--
-- This module is that independently specified event algebra, checked.
-- It proves the operational claims the strike left standing, and it
-- claims NOTHING about prāgabhāva or pradhvaṃsābhāva — the struck
-- reading is quoted in ABHAVA.md where it lives, with its strike.
--
-- The theorems, in the repository's own vocabulary:
--
--   1. PENDING IS MADELESS: the pending status holds exactly on the
--      empty log.  No event sustains "not yet decided"; it is what
--      there is before any event, and one proof ends it.
--   2. REFUTATION ABSORBS: once the fold reads refuted, no later
--      event changes the reading.  A refutation cannot be outvoted
--      by enthusiasm — the absorbing law the organism's design
--      ("genuinely proven conclusions flood; refutations are
--      permanent") requires of its fold.
--   3. A BOOLEAN CANNOT CARRY IT: merge pending and refuted into one
--      "not proved" bit and no transition function on the bit can
--      simulate the fold — [] and [refute] read equal and diverge
--      under prove.  The two-valued verdict on the three-valued
--      question cannot compute the future; refuted claims would come
--      back to life.  This is the typed zero's founding defect
--      (machinery/crystal's UNDECIDED split; Saptabhangi's दुर्नयः),
--      here as a ⊥ about the ledger itself.
--
-- Provenance fence: whether this algebra matches the Vaiśeṣika
-- temporal characterisations (anādi/sānta for prior absence,
-- sādi/ananta for posterior) is exactly the struck question, and this
-- module supplies no evidence either way.  If someone reopens it, the
-- study to check is named in ABHAVA.md A1 (Matilal 1968).
