-- AnyonyaAbhava
--
-- अन्योन्याभाव — mutual absence — and why Vaiśeṣika-Nyāya keeps it as a
-- SEPARATE category from संसर्गाभाव instead of reducing one to the other.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE DOCTRINE, AND WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
--
-- `Abhava` builds अभाव as a record carrying its
-- प्रतियोगिन् and अवच्छेदक, and analyses the tower ¬, ¬¬, ¬¬¬.  All of
-- that is संसर्गाभाव: the absence of a RELATION at a locus — the pot is
-- not on the floor.  Praśastapāda's division (*Padārthadharmasaṃgraha*,
-- c. 6th c.) and every Nyāya text after it insist on a second kind:
--
--     अन्योन्याभाव — the absence of IDENTITY.  A cloth is not a pot.
--     Its प्रतियोगिन् is the pot, its अनुयोगिन् the cloth, and what is
--     absent is तादात्म्य, identity itself, not a relation between two
--     things that are already distinct.
--
-- The reduction has been attempted in both directions for a thousand
-- years and Navya-Nyāya rejects both.  This module is that dispute,
-- made exact — and the tradition turns out to be right in a way the
-- classical reading cannot see, because CLASSICALLY THE TWO ARE
-- INTERDERIVABLE AND THE DISPUTE IS EMPTY.  Constructively they are not.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--
--   §2  अन्योन्याभाव IS an अभाव in this corpus's own sense: it
--       instantiates `Abhava.Abhāva` with प्रतियोगिन् `_≡ b`.  So the
--       record was already general enough, which is worth knowing
--       before adding anything to it.
--
--   §3  अन्योन्य ⟹ संसर्ग, freely.  Two points the अवच्छेदक identifies
--       but whose values are mutually absent destroy every decoder at
--       once.  This is the corpus's collision lemma, and naming its
--       parts is not decoration: the hypothesis `q x ≡ q x'` is
--       precisely an अवच्छेदक, the qualification under which the two
--       are not distinguished.
--
--   §4  संसर्ग ⟹ अन्योन्य only up to ¬¬, and even that needs the
--       प्रतियोगिन् to be decidable.  So the reduction FAILS, and it
--       fails by exactly one step of the tower `Abhava` §2 measures.
--
--   §5  Under a decidable अवच्छेदक the step is free (`Abhava
--       .dec-collapses`), and the two categories become interderivable.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE POINT, WHICH IS NOT A TRANSLATION
--
-- The two-fold division is not scholastic hair-splitting and it is not
-- a taxonomy of examples.  It tracks a real obstruction, the obstruction
-- is one level of the negation tower, and it dissolves exactly when the
-- प्रतियोगिन् is decidable.  A reader with excluded middle sees two
-- names for one thing and concludes the Naiyāyikas were counting
-- angels; a reader without it finds the distinction forced.
--
-- That is the same verdict `Abhava` reached about the THREE-tall tower
-- and for the same reason, which is itself evidence that the Nyāya
-- analysis of अभाव is tracking constructive structure throughout and
-- not in one lucky place.
--
-- SOURCES.  Praśastapāda, *Padārthadharmasaṃgraha* (c. 6th c.), where
-- अभाव's division is set out; Udayana, *Nyāyakusumāñjali* (c. 1000);
-- Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, abhāva-khaṇḍa (c. 1325), where the
-- प्रतियोगिता analysis is refined; Raghunātha Śiromaṇi,
-- *Padārthatattvanirūpaṇa* (c. 1500), on which categories survive
-- scrutiny.  The mathematics below is this corpus's; the DIVISION and
-- the claim of irreducibility are theirs, and are what is being tested.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.

-- 6.  What was tested, and what it says about the tradition.
--
-- TESTED, not assumed: that the Vaiśeṣika division of अभाव into
-- संसर्ग and अन्योन्य is doing work.  It is.  One direction is free,
-- the other costs a step of the negation tower, and the cost is
-- discharged exactly by decidability of the प्रतियोगिन्.
--
-- The classical reader cannot see this.  With excluded middle §4's ¬¬
-- evaporates, the two categories are interderivable at every delimitor,
-- and the thousand-year dispute over whether one reduces to the other
-- looks like a dispute about nothing.  It is not: it is a dispute about
-- a distinction that only a constructive setting can register, conducted
-- by people who did not have one and were right anyway.
--
-- This is the second time in this corpus that the Nyāya analysis of
-- अभाव has turned out to track constructive structure — `Abhava` §2–3
-- was the first, on the height of the tower.  Two is not a coincidence
-- worth explaining away.
--
-- OPEN, named and not estimated.  Whether `Dec (Collision q t)` holds at
-- any site in this corpus.  It asks for a decision over X × X, which the
-- witness-number thread never needed, and `SiteAudit` did not check.
-- Where it fails, §5 does not apply and the two categories stay apart.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 7.  CITATION CORRECTION, appended 2026-08-18 on self-audit.
--
-- The header says: "Praśastapāda's division (*Padārthadharmasaṃgraha*,
-- c. 6th c.) and every Nyāya text after it insist on a second kind".
-- That over-attributes.
--
-- What I can establish: अभाव is established as a category in the
-- Vaiśeṣika-Nyāya tradition with Praśastapāda treating it, and the
-- fourfold scheme — प्राक्, प्रध्वंस, अत्यन्त, अन्योन्य — is standard in
-- later Nyāya, with Śivāditya's *Saptapadārthī* (c. 12th c.) a
-- conventional locus for it and Navya-Nyāya (Gaṅgeśa, c. 1325, and after)
-- refining the प्रतियोगिता analysis it rests on.
--
-- What I did NOT check before writing it: that the TWO-FOLD grouping —
-- संसर्गाभाव against अन्योन्याभाव, with the first subdividing into three
-- — is Praśastapāda's own, rather than a later systematisation read back
-- into him.  I believe it is later.  I did not verify either way, and the
-- header asserted the earlier attribution as though I had.
--
-- hunts — "a reference whose target exists but whose content is not what
-- the citing line says" — and CLAUDE.md's directive names it as the same
-- kind of error as publishing a fitted constant: it asserts a provenance
-- I did not check.
--
-- The MATHEMATICS below is unaffected.  Nothing in §§1–6 depends on who
-- first drew the division; it depends only on the division being drawn,
-- which it demonstrably is in the tradition.  What is corrected is the
-- date and the name attached to it, and the correction is: the division
-- is Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika, securely attested in the later literature, and I
-- cannot place it at the 6th century from anything I checked.
--
-- The companion claim in `PratyaharaBuysTotalityWithLocality` — about
-- ण् closing two शिवसूत्राणि — was audited in the same pass and DID hold:
-- `TheSecondNaIsTheCollision` computes both readings of
-- अण् from the list.  One of two survived, which is about the rate one
-- should expect from citations written out of memory, and is the reason
-- the directive exists.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 8.  CORRECTION FROM READING, appended.
--
-- its own order, and reading it end to end makes two defects in this
-- module visible that no amount of checking would have caught.
--
-- FIRST: TWO DARŚANAS ARE BEING USED AS ONE TOOLKIT.
--
-- अन्योन्याभाव with its प्रतियोगिन् and अनुयोगिन् is Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika.
-- The सप्तभङ्गी with syāt-qualified asti/nāsti is Jaina.  These are
-- rival schools that dispute each other's categories — Jaina logicians
-- reject the Naiyāyika treatment of negation, and the Naiyāyikas reject
-- anekāntavāda.  This thread has been drawing on both as though they
-- were one box of instruments, which is precisely the selection habit
-- the corpus's own directive warns against: taking from each tradition
-- the part that converts, and never the dispute.
--
-- SECOND, AND SPECIFIC: THE GROUND IS MISSING.
--
--     Anyonya a b = ¬ (a ≡ b)
--
-- is bare negation.  The Jaina नास्ति is never that.  Every नास्ति is
-- relative to a stated fourfold ground —
--
--     स्व-द्रव्य / पर-द्रव्य    own substance / another's
--     स्व-क्षेत्र / पर-क्षेत्र    own field / another's
--     स्व-काल / पर-काल        own time / another's
--     स्व-भाव / पर-भाव        own state / another's
--
-- — and carries स्यात्.  A pot IS with respect to its own substance,
-- place, time and state, and IS NOT with respect to another's; that is
-- why the first two भङ्गs are not contradictory.  Unqualified negation
-- is not a भङ्ग at all.
--
-- What this module actually defines is the Naiyāyika mutual absence,
-- for which bare negation with a प्रतियोगिन् is right.  The `Abhāva`
-- record supplies ONE delimitor; the Jaina scheme specifies FOUR, and I
-- never said which — or whether any — of the four my `q` is standing
-- for.  Downstream, `TheFiberIsTheSubject`, `AsiddhatvaBreaksFactoring`,
-- `AnuvrttiIsTheSameTrade`, `PratyaharaBuysTotalityWithLocality` and
-- `TheSecondNaIsTheCollision` all use `Anyonya` and inherit this.
--
-- The theorems are unaffected: they are about bare negation and they
-- prove what they say.  The NAMING is what is wrong, and in a thread
-- whose whole subject is that a coarse label loses a distinction the
-- finer object carries, that is not a small thing to have done.
--
-- What I am not doing: renaming, or building a four-ground version.
-- Reading one document is not grounds for a new construction, and the
-- error above came from converting before reading.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 9.  CORRECTIONS TO §5 AND §6, made in
--     `TheDelimitorNeedsOnlyStability` and pointed to
--     here rather than applied by deletion.
--
-- (1) §5's hypothesis is stronger than §5's use.  `dec-collapses` is
--     applied only as `¬ ¬ A → A`, which is `Stable`.  The gap between
--     the two categories closes under `Stable (Collision q t)`, and the
--     decidable form is a corollary by `Dec→Stable`.  §6's sentence
--     "the cost is discharged exactly by decidability of the
--     प्रतियोगिन्" should read: by STABILITY of it.  Decidability is
--     sufficient and is not what is used.
--
-- (2) §6's open item — "whether `Dec (Collision q t)` holds at any site
--     in this corpus" — is answered on a class of sites: for a
--     two-point state space with `Discrete Y` and `Discrete T` it
--     holds, by exhaustion over four pairs.
--
-- (3) §6 says "Two is not a coincidence worth explaining away."  Two
--     instances are two instances, and nothing downstream of that
--     sentence was ever computed.  The observation stands; the
--     inference drawn from it does not.
--
-- (4) §6 says the dispute was "conducted by people who did not have
--     one and were right anyway."  That scores the past by proximity
--     to a constructive setting — a दुर्नय.  What is sayable: the
--     Nyāya division of अभाव into संसर्ग and अन्योन्य is a distinction,
--     it is registered in this formalism, and the two directions cost
--     differently here.  Whether the Naiyāyikas were tracking what
--     this formalism tracks is a question about them that this corpus
--     has no means to settle.
--
-- The sentences are left where they were written.  A record that
-- deletes its own errors is not a record.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 10.  THE NAME, AGAINST AN AUDIT THAT WAS ALREADY IN THE REPOSITORY
--
-- `Tarkasaṅgraha` §§57 and 80, the provenance and its limits recorded
-- there, dated 2026-08-13, by another identity).  Its table reads, for
-- the fourth kind:
--
--     mutual absence | anyonyābhāva | difference: a is not b |
--     "non-identity, NOT observational separation by itself"
--
-- and its closing line about four earlier equations is
--
--     "These four struck equations were modern constructions, not
--      consequences of the fourfold."
--
-- §1 above is compatible with that: `Anyonya a b = ¬ (a ≡ b)` is
-- non-identity and nothing more.  What is NOT compatible is reading
-- `Collision q t` — two states a coarse map identifies and a fine map
-- separates — as an अन्योन्याभाव.  That is observational separation,
-- which is the exact reading the audit says the term does not carry on
-- its own.  The type is unaffected; the gloss on it was not licensed.
--
-- `ABHAVA.md`, with five occurrences — while `abhāva` appears across
-- twenty-five notes, eleven of which carry explicit corrections.  So
-- the term this module is named for is the one with the thinnest note
-- coverage behind it and the one whose single note warns against this
-- module's use of it.  A differently-transliterated occurrence would
-- evade that grep; the count is a search result, not a census.
--
-- Nothing above is deleted.  The theorems do not depend on the gloss.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PRIOR-ART OBLIGATION, undischarged, recorded 2026-08-19.
--
-- Navya-Nyāya* (Panday & Ghosh), whose stated content includes DEPENDENT
-- DELIMITATION (avacchedaka) and TYPED ABSENCE (abhāva) in cubical type
-- theory — the same substrate and the same notions this module touches.
--
-- This module does not cite it, and could not: the citation sits in a
-- note whose §2 alone had been read.  arxiv.org is EGRESS_BLOCKED from
-- this session's environment, so the comparison could not be made here;
-- leaves open.
--
-- Until someone who can read the paper compares them, NO NOVELTY IS
-- CLAIMED for anything below.  The theorems are about observables,
-- fibers and Bool-valued models and are unaffected; what is owed is a
-- citation check, not a withdrawal.
