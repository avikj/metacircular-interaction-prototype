-- FuelAdequacyIsACollision
--
-- Sixth site of `TranscriptDescent.collisionObstructsDecoder`, and the
-- first one that is about this repository's own code rather than about
-- mathematics.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHERE THIS CAME FROM
--
-- `ExponentBound` had to prove that `FrontierList.logOf`'s fuel budget
-- is adequate, because nothing had.  The audit question that followed
-- was: why did THAT function escape when twenty modules here are fuel
-- driven?  The answer is a type-level criterion, and it is sharp:
--
--   `Factorisation.factorise-fuel : (fuel n : ℕ) → 0 < n → n ≤ fuel
--                                 → Factorisation n`
--   `CoprimeSplitting`'s atom      : … → n ≤ fuel → Σ[ p ] (IsPrime p × p ∣ n)
--   `PFreePart.pFree-fuel`         : … → m ≤ fuel → Split p m
--   `KFlow`                        : … → n ≤ fuel → …
--
-- every one of them takes the budget as a HYPOTHESIS and returns a Σ
-- carrying its own postcondition.  For those, adequacy is discharged by
-- the type: the postcondition is a projection of the result, and there
-- is no theorem left to prove.
--
--   `FrontierList.expOf : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ`
--
-- takes the budget as bare data and returns bare data.  It is the only
-- one of the twenty in that shape, and it is the only one whose
-- adequacy went unproved for the corpus's whole history — carried
-- instead by `frontier8 = refl`.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE CRITERION, MADE EXACT
--
-- "Bare data cannot carry adequacy" is a slogan until it is a
-- collision.  Here it is one.  Fix the base p = 2 and let the input be
-- the pair (k , gas).  Then
--
--     bare (k , g)       =  expOf 2 k g
--     saturated (k , g)  =  has the climb stopped? — i.e. is
--                           2 ^ (suc (expOf 2 k g)) already past k?
--
-- and the two inputs (2 , 1) and (8 , 1) are a collision:
--
--     expOf 2 2 1  =  1  =  expOf 2 8 1
--     saturated (2 , 1) = true   (2² = 4 > 2, the climb is finished)
--     saturated (8 , 1) = false  (2² = 4 ≤ 8, it has further to go)
--
-- So no decoder on the returned value recovers adequacy, and by the
-- corpus's own lemma that is not a gap in anyone's cleverness — it is
-- `¬ FactorsThrough bare saturated`.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- AND THE REPAIR, IN THE SAME IDIOM
--
-- A collision names the missing distinction, and here the distinction
-- is `k`.  Return the value paired with the bound and adequacy factors
-- immediately, with the decoder written out:
--
--     withK (k , g) = (k , expOf 2 k g)
--     saturated-factors : FactorsThrough withK saturated
--
-- which is the type `expOf` should have had, in the weakest form that
-- works.  The Σ-returning fuelled functions listed above are the strong
-- form of the same repair, and that is why none of them needed a
-- theorem.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE SCOPE, EXACTLY
--
-- It does not claim `expOf` is wrong.  `ExponentBound` proves it right.
-- It claims the correctness was not IN the type, and locates the exact
-- information the type was missing.  Nor does it audit the remaining
-- fuelled modules line by line: the criterion is stated, four instances
-- are checked against it by inspection of their signatures above, and
-- the rest are named as unaudited rather than assumed clean.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.

-- 5.  What the sixth site adds to the other five.
--
-- about representations of mathematical objects: लाघव over expressions,
-- अनुवृत्ति over rule lists, carry/borrow over digit strings, the
-- transcript over machine states, the Jain सप्तभङ्गी over standpoints.
--
-- This one is about a TYPE SIGNATURE in this repository, and it says
-- something the other five could not: the discipline in CLAUDE.md — that
-- a computed instance must not stand in for a theorem — has a mechanical
-- shadow.  Where the return type of a fuelled function is bare data, the
-- adequacy claim provably cannot ride along, so it will be carried by a
-- `refl` at one input or by nothing at all.  Where the return type is a
-- Σ, it rides along by construction.
--
-- That is a criterion an agent can apply without reading the proofs, and
-- it found the one instance in twenty.
