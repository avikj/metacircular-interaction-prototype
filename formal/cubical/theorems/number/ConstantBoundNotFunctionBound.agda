-- ConstantBoundNotFunctionBound
--
-- A CONSTANT that cannot be improved by a constant, and a FUNCTION that
-- improves it.  The quantifier the summary moved, made a type.
--
-- SOURCE SENTENCE (`notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_6.md` §C1, quoting
-- `collab/messages/workers/20260812T144712.509661Z--claude_aime_body--
-- 0003.md`):
--
--   "Φ₇(2)=127 prime … Φ₁₇(2)=131071 prime … So Y≥1 is sharp, **no
--    function of (b,n) improves it**."
--
-- The two witnesses are correct and establish that the CONSTANT bound 1
-- cannot be raised to a constant > 1.  They do not establish the
-- quantified claim about FUNCTIONS of (b,n): the audit's refutation is
-- Φ₁₁(2) = 2047 = 23·89, where the yield is 2, so the function equal to
-- 2 at (2,11) and 1 elsewhere is a valid bound strictly better than the
-- constant.  I re-derived the three arithmetic facts by hand before
-- writing this:  2⁷−1 = 127 and 2¹⁷−1 = 131071 are prime, 2¹¹−1 = 2047
-- = 23·89, and for prime n the primitive part Φ_n(2) is all of 2ⁿ−1.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT FORMALIZED.  The cyclotomic arithmetic is NOT
-- formalized; it enters only as the three values of `Y` below, named as
-- such.  What is formalized is the quantifier structure, which is where
-- the defect lives: the source sentence's "no function of (b,n)" scopes
-- a universal over FUNCTIONS outside a claim whose evidence is two
-- POINTS.  Both the sharpness proof and its refutation are one line
-- each, which is the point — the argument to fix the sentence is
-- shorter than the sentence's own evidence.
--
-- NO LEXICAL SIGNATURE.  "No function of (b,n) improves it" and "the
-- constant 1 cannot be improved" share no distinguishing word; the
-- defect is a quantifier promotion inside a sentence in which every
-- word is correct.
--
-- HEADLINE TERMS
--   Y                      the yield, with its three known values
--   constant-sharp         no CONSTANT bound exceeds 1
--   Y-is-a-bound           Y itself is a valid function bound
--   Y-improves            ... and exceeds 1 at (2,11)
--   dropped-scope-false    so "no function improves it" implies ⊥
