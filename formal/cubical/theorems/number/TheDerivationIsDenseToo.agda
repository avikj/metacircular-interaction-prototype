-- TheDerivationIsDenseToo
--
-- A scope correction to `NumberIsExponentialInDerivation`, made the same
-- session, by the same author, before anyone had to find it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE OVER-REACH
--
-- That module proves `suc e ≤ b ^ e` — the numeric factor is exponential
-- in the exponent it encodes — and then files the walk's size under
-- "IDENTIFIED: the numeric encoding", opposite "OPEN: its magnitude".
--
-- The theorem is right.  The filing is not.  "Identified" says the
-- encoding ACCOUNTS for the gap between what the walk carries and what
-- distinguishing k inputs requires, and that does not follow from a
-- coordinatewise bound, because it says nothing about HOW MANY
-- COORDINATES there are.
--
-- And there are many.  cap(k) = lcm(1..k) is divisible by every prime
-- p ≤ k, so its derivation has a nonzero entry at every such p:
--
--     the walk's derivation is DENSE.
--
-- `cap-is-dense` below checks this for the walk's frontier-8 state
-- against the basis 2,3,5,7 — every coordinate nonzero, support 4 out of
-- 4.  So the derivation is not a compact object either.  Its coordinate
-- count grows with the number of primes below the frontier, and the
-- exponential saving `suc e ≤ b ^ e` buys nothing across coordinates,
-- only within one.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE CORRECTED VERDICT
--
--   the numeric encoding is A mechanism of the walk's size.  Whether it
--   is THE mechanism depends on comparing a sum of exponents against a
--   count of primes, which is exactly the Chebyshev-type input the
--   previous module said it was not using.
--
-- So that row moves from IDENTIFIED back to OPEN, and it moves for the
-- same reason it was placed there: the estimate is unavailable in this
-- lane and quoting it would be the error CLAUDE.md forbids.  The previous
-- module's own boundary paragraph forbade the conclusion its table drew,
-- one screen further down.  That is worth recording as a failure mode in
-- its own right: **a correctly-hedged file whose summary table forgets
-- the hedge.**
--
-- WHAT SURVIVES.  `suc≤^` and `1≤^` are unaffected, as is everything in
-- §§1–2 of that module.  What is withdrawn is the word "IDENTIFIED".
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.

-- 4.  The corrected verdict, in one line.
--
-- The number is exponential in each exponent (previous module) AND the
-- derivation has one exponent per prime below the frontier (here).  The
-- first is a saving within a coordinate; the second is a cost across
-- them; and which dominates is a question about ∑_{p≤k} versus π(k) that
-- neither module answers.
--
-- The walk's magnitude is OPEN.  It was open before the previous module
-- and it is open after it, and saying so is the whole content of this
-- file.
