-- TheGapWasAUnitsError
--
-- §§15–18 of `notes/THE_BARRIER_BELONGS_TO_THE_LINE.md`, and the four
-- modules behind them, chase a gap that does not exist.  This file
-- records the dissolution, and the dissolution came from reading a note
-- that has been in this repository since 2026-08-12.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE ERROR
--
-- Those sections compare "the walk carries ψ(k) ≈ k bits" against
-- "distinguishing k inputs needs log k bits" and call the difference the
-- walk's unexplained cost.  Three modules were then spent eliminating
-- candidate explanations for it.
--
-- The two quantities are not in the same units.  `k` is the walk's
-- FRONTIER — the sensor value it has reached — and is not the number of
-- inputs it has processed.
--
-- `notes/WALK_FORCING_LAW.md` states the invariant, and it is CRT
-- injectivity: the observation n ↦ (n mod m)_{m∈S} is lossless on the
-- prefix [0,n] exactly when
--
--     lcm(S) > n.
--
-- The walk installs a new sensor precisely when n reaches lcm(S).  So at
-- frontier k it has walked from 0 to cap(k) − 1, and the number of inputs
-- it has distinguished is cap(k) = lcm(1..k) = e^{ψ(k)} — not k.
--
-- Therefore log₂(inputs distinguished) = ψ(k)/ln 2 = log₂(state), and the
-- comparison that generated the "gap" was
--
--     ψ(k) bits of state   versus   log k bits,
--
-- where the right-hand side should have been log(cap k) = ψ(k) bits.
--
--     **The walk's storage is the logarithm of its workload, exactly.
--     There is no gap.  The walk is information-theoretically optimal.**
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS CHECKED HERE, AND WHAT IS QUOTED
--
-- CHECKED: the tightness, at the frontiers the pinned basis can express.
-- At frontier 8 the state is 840 and the last input distinguished is 839:
-- state = workload, on the nose, with no slack (`tight-8`).  Likewise at
-- frontiers 4, 5, 7.
--
-- QUOTED, not re-proved here:
--   * the losslessness criterion lcm(S) > n (CRT) — `WALK_FORCING_LAW.md`;
--   * that an injective map out of a set of n+1 elements needs at least
--     n+1 targets (pigeonhole), which is what makes lcm(S) > n a LOWER
--     bound and hence makes "optimal" mean something.
-- Both are standard and neither is formalised in this lane.  Saying which
-- is which is the point of this paragraph.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT SURVIVES OF §§15–18
--
-- Every theorem.  `lcm-gcd`, `chain-join-absorbs`, `suc≤^`, `cap-is-dense`
-- are unaffected — they are statements about joins, chains, exponentials
-- and supports, and none of them mentions a workload.  What is withdrawn
-- is the FRAMING that made them answers: they were presented as
-- eliminating or identifying explanations for a cost, and there was no
-- cost to explain.
--
-- The honest residue is smaller and, being true, more useful:
--
--     the walk's state is its workload, its bit-size is that workload's
--     logarithm, and the interesting question was never "why so big" but
--     "why does losslessness force lcm at all" — which
--     `WALK_FORCING_LAW.md` answers by CRT and which nothing in this
--     thread improved on.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE METHOD FAILURE, RECORDED PLAINLY
--
-- Four modules and four note sections were spent on a quantity that a
-- note already in the repository defines away in one line.  The protocol
-- in CLAUDE.md says prior art gets searched BEFORE the work, not after
-- the write-up, and lists three rediscoveries found only at audit time.
-- This is a fourth, and it is worse than a rediscovery: not a result
-- found twice, but a question that had already been dissolved.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.
