-- CakravalaNat — the cycle's step over ℕ, every subtraction cleared.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  `CakravalaDescent.agda` proves the step over an
-- arbitrary commutative ring, which is the right generality and is also
-- unusable for certifying an actual run.  Cubical's ℤ multiplication is
-- UNARY —
--
--     pos (suc n) · m = m + pos n · m        (Cubical/Data/Int/Base.agda)
--
-- — so a `refl` on the nine-digit integers the cakravāla produces at D = 61
-- asks the kernel for about 10¹⁸ unfoldings and never returns.  An attempt
-- had to be killed.  Cubical's ℕ is `Agda.Builtin.Nat`, whose `_+_` and
-- `_·_` are GMP-backed, so the identical statement over ℕ is instant.
--
-- THE REPAIR IS THE ONE THIS REPOSITORY ALREADY USES.  `BhavanaSemiring`
-- found that bhāvanā is FALSE over ℕ as classically written, because monus
-- truncates, and that moving every negative term across makes it true with
-- no hypothesis at all — and, better, makes it a commutative-SEMIRING
-- identity, so it needs no induction, no ordering and no subtraction.  The
-- same move works here, and this file is that move applied to the cycle
-- rather than to the composition.
--
-- WHAT IS CLEARED.  `Bhavana.cakravalaCleared` says
--
--     N D a b · (m² − D)  ≡  N D (am + Db) (a + bm)
--
-- Expand both sides; the cross terms 2abDm cancel and what remains is
--
--     a²m² + D²b² − Da² − Db²m²
--
-- on each side.  Carrying the two negative terms across gives a statement
-- with no subtraction anywhere:
--
--     (am + Db)² + D·a² + D·b²m²  ≡  a²m² + D²b² + D·(a + bm)²
--
-- Over ℤ that IS `cakravalaCleared`, by adding the same two terms to both
-- sides.  Over ℕ it is true for ALL naturals, with no hypothesis, and it is
-- a semiring identity — so `solve` discharges it and no case analysis on the
-- sign of k is needed.  The sign of k was the whole obstacle to stating the
-- cycle over ℕ, and clearing the subtraction removes it rather than handling
-- it.
--
-- WHAT THIS BUYS.  Each turn of a concrete run can now be certified by
-- INSTANTIATING this theorem at that turn's numbers, in arithmetic the
-- kernel actually computes.  `machine/NalandaEmit.hs` does exactly that.
-- The alternative — emitting `refl` for each turn — would prove only that
-- the generator's arithmetic agrees with the kernel's, and would not tie the
-- run to Brahmagupta's law at all.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT HERE.  Termination, and Bhāskara's minimality rule.  Those are
-- open in `CakravalaDescent.agda` and remain open; nothing below touches
-- them.  Nor does this file recover k and k' — it is the step's IDENTITY,
-- not the step's bookkeeping, and the bookkeeping is where the signs live.
