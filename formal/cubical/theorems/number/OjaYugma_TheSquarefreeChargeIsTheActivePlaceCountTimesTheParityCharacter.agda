-- ओजयुग्म — oja / yugma, odd and even.  The Jaina canon classifies a rāśi by
-- its remainder — the fourfold kṛtayugma / tryoja / dvāparayugma / kalyoja of
-- the Bhagavatī Sūtra (Vyākhyāprajñapti), with the oja/yugma pair also in the
-- Sthānāṅga; the canon as redacted at Valabhī, c. 5th c. CE, the material
-- older.  The sūtra number is NOT pinned here: the fourfold is standard in
-- those texts and the exact citation was not opened, so this says text and
-- date and stops rather than inventing a number.  Nothing below is attributed
-- to those texts.  What is taken is the term for the parity of a count.
--
-- WHAT THIS CHECKS, and where its two halves come from.
--
-- The Lean lane carries a tensor `squarefreeChargeCube n`
-- (`formal/lean/Pairfield/PrimeChargeArbitraryRank.lean`) on n squarefree
-- prime places, whose CP rank is exactly n.  Its definition, transcribed:
--
--     signFactor   b = if b then -1 else 1
--     activeFactor b = if b then  1 else 0
--     chargeTerm marked = one pure term: activeFactor at the marked place,
--                         signFactor at every other place
--     squarefreeChargeCube n x = Σ over marked of that pure term at x
--
-- the critical affine arithmetic system, its grading operator Ω, and the
-- parity character λ = (−1)^Ω — the torus evaluated at (−1,−1,…).  Theorem F
-- says every gauge-charged observable has equilibrium expectation exactly
-- zero, which is the sieve parity barrier.
--
-- BillIsItsGradedForm.md` claims those are one charge, and marks the claim an
-- IDENTIFICATION exhibited on index sets and signs rather than a checked map.
-- This module removes that qualification for the algebraic half, on a list of
-- places rather than `Fin n → Bool`:
--
--     आवेशः bs ≡ - (pos (ओजः bs) · पर्यायः bs)
--
-- the squarefree charge is the active-place count times the parity character,
-- negated.  So the tensor whose rank is exactly n and the graded object of
-- Theorem F are one function of the places, and r = 0 — the twirl's neutral
-- sector — is the statement that this function's expectation vanishes.
--
-- NOT checked here: that the Lean lane's `Fin n → Bool` form and this
-- `List Bool` form agree.  They carry the same data in a different index
-- shape, no map is exhibited between the lanes, and two lanes agreeing on a
-- formula is not a map.  Nothing here touches KMS states; that is Theorem F's
-- own content and lives in prose.

-- activeFactor there, the sign on all the rest, which is `सक्रियम् b · पर्यायः bs`

-- Three are definitional; the fourth needs `pos0+`, because `_+_` on ℤ
-- recurses on its right argument and `pos 0 + z` is not `z` on the nose.

-- The rank theorem — rank exactly n — is the Lean lane's and is not restated
-- here; what is checked here is only that the function whose rank that
-- theorem measures is the parity character scaled by the active-place count.
