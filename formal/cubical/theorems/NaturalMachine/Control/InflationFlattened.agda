--
-- *** THIS FILE MUST FAIL TO TYPE-CHECK. ***
--
-- Designed annihilation (collab/PROTOCOL.md §7), in the pattern of
-- `Control/WrongEquivalence.agda`, `Control/WrongFirstStep.agda` and
-- `Control/QuantifierDrop.agda`.
--
-- WHAT IT ASSERTS.  Thm 3.5 of
-- `notes/EIGHT_CLASSES_COLLAPSE_TO_FOUR_SLOTS.md` — "inflation
-- H¹(Γ,V) → H¹(G,V) is injective for Γ = G/N", i.e. enlargement ALONG A
-- QUOTIENT is not a repair — as it is restated once the qualifier is
-- dropped: "symmetry enlargement … is **not a repair at all**" (§2.8),
-- "widening *symmetry* cannot [kill]" (§3.5 Reading), "*refuted, not a
-- repair*" (§4 table), "proved to be no repair" (§5.5).  The audit
-- `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_5.md` §D7 catalogues exactly this drop: §0's
-- row keeps "along a quotient" and every other statement of the result
-- loses it.
--
-- WHY IT MUST FAIL.  Under the flat reading the theorem would cover the
-- OTHER enlargement, a subgroup inclusion Γ ≤ G — where there is no
-- canonical H¹(Γ,V) → H¹(G,V) at all, only restriction going the other
-- way.  On the model of `NaturalMachine.InflationVersusSubgroup`
-- (G = ℤ/4 ⊇ N = {0,2} = ker(G ↠ Γ), V = ℤ/2) the map that would have
-- to exist does not: `res` is identically zero, so nothing splits it,
-- and `infl` — the quotient theorem's own map — is not a section of it.
-- `InflationVersusSubgroup.flattened-enlargement-false` derives ⊥ from
-- precisely the type asserted below.
--
-- The two assertions are the two ways the flattening actually happens
-- in prose: (a) hand the subgroup reading the quotient theorem's map,
-- (b) build the "inflation" for a subgroup by precomposing with the
-- inclusion — which is the direction error the word "enlargement" hides.
--
-- This is the instrument for a defect with NO LEXICAL SIGNATURE: the
-- flattened sentence contains no wrong word, only a missing
-- qualifier, so grep cannot see it and a type can.
--
-- It is NOT part of the checked build.  `NaturalMachine.agda` does not
-- import it, and nothing else may: the directory `NaturalMachine/Control/`
-- is excluded from the root aggregate exactly so its contents may fail.
--
-- OBSERVED, 2026-08-15, container toolchain (Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5;
-- `formal/cubical/BUILD.md` pins 2.8.0 + v0.9, check OUTSTANDING),
-- `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 agda NaturalMachine/Control/InflationFlattened.agda`,
-- exit code 42, error verbatim:
--
--   /home/user/math/formal/cubical/NaturalMachine/Control/InflationFlattened.agda:91,28-32
--   k0 != kι of type H2
--   when checking that the expression refl has type res (infl kι) ≡ kι
--
-- Read it: the checker refuses to identify the restriction to the
-- SUBGROUP of the inflated class (`k0`, zero — restriction along
-- N ↪ ℤ/4 kills everything) with the class itself (`kι`).  The dropped
-- qualifier "along a quotient" is what the machine names, by exhibiting
-- the two things the flat word "enlargement" runs together.  The `k0`
-- case one line above type-checks, which is why the flattened reading
-- looks true if you only test the zero class.
--
-- (Agda stops at the first error, so the second assertion,
-- `inflation-along-the-inclusion`, is not reached.  Checked separately
-- by commenting out the first (same file, three lines commented out,
-- then restored): it fails at 97,50-56 with
--   Z4 !=< Z2
--   when checking that the inferred type of an application
--     Z4
--   matches the expected type
--     Z2
-- — the inclusion `incl : Z2 → Z4` cannot be precomposed to push a
-- class forward; precomposition with an inclusion is restriction.)
--
-- If a future edit makes this file compile, the note's principal
-- negative has been silently extended to a reading its proof does not
-- reach, and the corpus has readmitted exactly the defect
-- `FULL_READ_DRAW_5` §D7 catalogued.
