-- DESCENT ALONG A SURJECTION OF SETS, WITH THE SPLIT HYPOTHESIS REMOVED
-- AND THE SURJECTIVITY HYPOTHESIS SHOWN TO BE NECESSARY.
--
-- WHAT THIS CLOSES
--
-- `DefectCalculus` §7 proves T15.40 in the direction that
-- matters only for a SPLIT surjection, and names its own gap verbatim:
--
--     "a genuine surjection needs the image quotient (a set-truncation)
--      to build `g`, so what is proved here is the split case … for the
--      general surjection this needs `Cubical.HITs.SetQuotients` and a
--      set hypothesis on `C`."
--
-- Half of that sentence is right and half is wrong, and the wrong half
-- is the interesting one:
--
--   * a set hypothesis on `C` is genuinely USED — `rec→Set` demands it,
--     and it is not shown necessary here (see WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED);
--   * **`SetQuotients` is not needed at all.**  No quotient is
--     constructed anywhere in this file.  The universal property of the
--     propositional truncation into a set — Kraus–Escardó–Coquand–
--     Altenkirch's factorisation of a 2-Constant map, `PT.rec→Set` —
--     supplies `g` directly.  This is the third or fourth time in this
--     corpus that a missing construction turned out to be a universal
--     property already installed (`notes/WALK_INSTALLS_ARE_JUMPS.md`),
--     and the fourth instance is worth recording because the corpus
--     ALREADY OWNED the tool: `FiniteInformation`
--     (`fiberConstant→factorsThrough`) does exactly this
--     truncation-into-a-set argument, choice-free, for factorisation
--     through `Image q`.  The only step it was missing is that for a
--     surjection `Image q` is `B`.  DefectCalculus §7 re-derived a
--     weaker statement, in the same tree, four files away — which is the
--     lesson DefectCalculus §4 narrates about itself ("grep before you
--     prove, including for four-line lemmas") arriving one section
--     later.  Nothing here is a criticism of that file; it is what the
--     joint is for.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--
--   §1  `isPropCoequalizes`      the descent datum is a proposition when
--                                the target is a set — so it can be
--                                carried by `Σ≡Prop` and never has to be
--                                compared.
--
--   §2  `descend` / `descend-β`  T15.40 substantive direction for an
--       `descends`               arbitrary surjection.  `descend-β` is
--                                one truncation-propositionality step
--                                away from `refl`.
--
--   §3  `descend-unique`         the factorisation is unique, and
--       `isPropFactorisation`    therefore the type of factorisations is
--                                a proposition.  Uniqueness is where
--                                surjectivity does its work; existence
--                                would survive weaker hypotheses.
--
--   §4  `restrictAlong`          THE STATEMENT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR.
--       `descentEquiv`           `(B → C) ≃ Σ[ f ∈ (A → C) ] Coequalizes q f`
--                                for `q` surjective and `C` a set: the
--                                descent problem is REPRESENTABLE, and
--                                `B` represents it.  Descent data along
--                                a one-map cover of sets are nothing but
--                                coequalising maps; there is no further
--                                cocycle to satisfy and no obstruction
--                                to vanish.
--
--   §5  `split→descends`         DefectCalculus's `descends-split` as a
--       `split-descent-agrees`   corollary (a split map is surjective),
--                                plus the sharper statement: the
--                                section-chosen factorisation `f ∘ s`
--                                EQUALS the choice-free one.  So a proof
--                                that picks a representative computes
--                                the right answer — it just assumes more
--                                than it needs.
--
--   §6  `hProp-descent→surjection`  the CONVERSE.  If the descent map is
--       `descentEquiv→surjection`   injective at the single set `hProp`
--                                — in particular if §4's `restrictAlong`
--                                is an equivalence there — then `q` is
--                                surjective.  With §4 this makes
--                                surjectivity EQUIVALENT to effective
--                                descent, so §2's hypothesis is not a
--                                convenience: it is the content.
--
--   §7  `notSurjection-absurd`   controls, both directions.  NEGATIVE:
--       `two-factorisations`     without surjectivity the factorisation
--       `descend-computes`       is genuinely non-unique (two different
--                                `g`, both checked, and a checked proof
--                                that they differ), so §3 is not
--                                vacuously true.  POSITIVE: on a concrete
--                                surjection `descend` REDUCES —
--                                `descend-computes` is `refl` — so §2 is
--                                not an inert term either.
--
--   §8  `FutureQuotient.R`       the corollary that made this worth
--       `FutureQuotient.R-unique`
--                                landing: `collab/messages/madhavi/
--                                future_quotient_linear_rank.md`
--                                Theorem (2) — "there is a unique matrix
--                                `R : Q × W → K` with `T = C R`" — is
--                                §2 + §3 at `C := W → K`.  Its published
--                                proof reads "Define `R(c,w) = T(x,w)`
--                                for any `x` with `q(x) = c`", i.e. it
--                                picks a representative.  Here no
--                                representative is picked.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * **§2 and §3 are already in this corpus, in prose.**  Searched
--    before written, and found: `notes/OBSERVABLE_DESCENT_COMMON_OBJECT.md`
--    (cf-tessera) states exactly this as its theorem (T) — "`f` factors
--    through `q` iff `f` is constant on every `q`-fibre" — and identifies
--    three lanes as instances of it.  Its rigor boundary names the gap
--    this file fills: *"the formal unification in one proof language is
--    open and named as the successor seed."*  So §2/§3 are a
--    formalisation of a landed prose theorem, not a new one.  What is
--    added beyond it is §4 (the representability packaging), §6 (that the
--    hypothesis is necessary, not merely sufficient), and the closing of
--    DefectCalculus §7's named gap together with the disproof of its
--    guess about the cost.
--
--  * **No novelty.**  "Surjections of sets are effective epimorphisms"
--    is standard; the converse is Mac Lane–Moerdijk p. 143 corollary 5,
--    which the pinned library already has as
--    `Cubical.Functions.Surjection.epi⇒surjective`.  §6 is a
--    repackaging of it at the subobject classifier.  The exact
--    difference, stated after a first draft of this comment got it
--    wrong: the library's `rightCancellable` quantifies over EVERY type
--    of `Type (ℓ-suc (ℓ ⊔ ℓ'))`, and §6 needs the SINGLE object
--    `hProp (ℓ ⊔ ℓ')` of that same universe.  `hProp` is not one level
--    lower — the subobject classifier never is — so the sharpening is
--    "one test object, and it is a set", not "a smaller universe".  It
--    is what makes §6 the literal converse of §4, whose hypothesis is
--    exactly "`C` is a set".  A hypothesis sharpening, not a theorem.
--
--  * **`isSet C` is not shown necessary.**  The honest ledger, since §5
--    could be misread as strict improvement: `descends-split` needs no
--    set hypothesis but needs a section; `descends` needs no section but
--    needs `isSet C`.  The two are INCOMPARABLE in hypotheses.  What §5
--    proves is only that once `C` is a set the split statement is
--    subsumed, and that the two produce the same function.  Exhibiting a
--    non-set `C` at which §4 fails would need `π₁(S¹)` and is not done.
--
--  * **This is about a ONE-MAP cover.**  `notes/PM_SECTION_VS_COCYCLE.md`
--    §2 locates the Peres–Mermin obstruction as "a property of the
--    *cover*, i.e. genuinely cohomological — of the nerve, not of the
--    operator set", each observable lying in exactly two contexts.  §4
--    is the exact statement of why that is the only place such an
--    obstruction can live: along a single surjection onto a set there is
--    nothing to obstruct.  That is a boundary remark about scope, and
--    NOT a claim about the Peres–Mermin computation, which is not
--    touched here.
--
--  * **Nothing here is about primes, or about defects.**  §2 is one
--    library lemma applied once.  The value is entirely in which
--    hypothesis was removed and which was shown necessary.

--

-- two subobjects of `B` that agree after restriction along `q` are "the
-- image of q" and "everything"; injectivity of `restrictAlong` at
-- `hProp` identifies them, which says exactly that every fibre is
-- inhabited.
--
-- PRIOR ART, cited not reproved: this is Mac Lane–Moerdijk p. 143
-- corollary 5, present in the pinned library as
-- `Cubical.Functions.Surjection.epi⇒surjective`.  That version demands
-- cancellation against EVERY type of `Type (ℓ-suc (ℓ ⊔ ℓ'))`; §6 demands
-- it against the SINGLE object `hProp (ℓ ⊔ ℓ')` of that same universe —
-- `hProp` is not one level lower, and the library's warning that "f must
-- cancel functions from a higher universe" applies here verbatim.  What
-- is bought is not a smaller universe but a smaller hypothesis: one test

-- `collab/messages/madhavi/future_quotient_linear_rank.md`, Theorem (2):
--
--     "There is a unique matrix `R : Q × W → K` such that `T = C R`,
--      `C(x,c) = 1` if `q(x) = c` and `0` otherwise."
--
-- `C` is the incidence matrix of the future-behaviour quotient map
-- `q : X → Q`, and `C R` is exactly `R ∘ q`.  Clause (1) of that theorem
-- ("`q x ≡ q y` iff row `T x` equals row `T y`") supplies, in its easy
-- direction, precisely `Coequalizes q T`.  So clause (2) is §2 + §3 at
-- the set `W → K`.
--
-- The published proof begins "Define `R(c,w) = T(x,w)` for ANY `x` with
-- `q(x) = c`" — a representative is chosen and well-definedness is then
-- argued.  Below, no representative is chosen: `q` is surjective ("every
-- quotient class is inhabited", the note's own hypothesis) and `K` is a
-- set, and that is the whole input.
