-- आसन्न — आसन्नो वृत्तपरिणाहः ।
--
-- (this is the APPROXIMATE circumference of a circle.)
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- last open PROVE item — asks that the BARRIER Structure Proposition be
-- made a theorem: WL observables factor through the blurred spectral
-- measure, hence no post-processing recovers what the blur merged.
--
-- It was proposed that the item SPLITS: the analytic half (that WL
-- observables do factor through the blur) stays open, while the second
-- half (that once they do, no refinement recovers the fibre) is already
-- available in general form from
-- `Vaidharmya_TheObstructionWasNeverClassicalAndTheAnswerTypeNeedOnlyBeApart`,
-- which removed `Bool` from `QuotientFiberLaw` and left
-- the negative half standing over an arbitrary answer type with an
-- arbitrary irreflexive separation.
--
-- **THE SPLIT AS PROPOSED IS NOT VALID, AND THIS MODULE IS WHY.**
--
-- `Vaidharmya`'s `AllBlind` demands that blind queries return EQUAL
-- answers — its own header says "not close, equal" — because its whole
-- proof is `cong decide` applied to an equality of transcripts.  An
-- analytic barrier lemma does not deliver equality.  It delivers
-- agreement to within ε: `BARRIER.md`'s own Corollary B2 asks only that
-- σ_k − σ_k′ be "annihilated at that resolution", with mismatch
-- O((δL)^{2p−1}), and `BARRIER_ERROR_WINDOW.md` Theorem U1 puts the
-- window's error term E at C_E X₀^{−1/2} Θ_φ(L/2), a NONZERO quantity
-- that depends on the configuration through the (k−1)-fold wave layer
-- 𝒵_{k−1}.  Two configurations agreeing under the blur therefore give
-- transcripts that are CLOSE, never equal, and `cong` fires on nothing.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.  Three statements, no analysis, no numerics.
--
--   §२  **The near-law.**  Replace equality of answers by an arbitrary
--       tolerance relation `_≈_` and the law survives — PROVIDED the
--       decoder respects the tolerance and the tolerance excludes the
--       separation.  Proof is four lines and mentions no constructor.
--
--   §३  **Where the exact case got its hypothesis for free.**  Take
--       `_≈_ := _≡_` and `Respects decide` is inhabited for EVERY
--       decoder, by `cong`.  That is precisely the hypothesis
--       `Vaidharmya` never had to state, and precisely the one the
--       analytic setting must now pay for.
--
--   §४  **The gap is real, and here is a counterexample.**  Near
--       blindness ALONE — with the arbitrary post-processing that
--       `BARRIER.md`'s Proposition B3 explicitly insists on ("even
--       non-computable") — implies NO obstruction whatever.  One state
--       space of two points, one query, answers 1 and 0, tolerance
--       "differ by at most one": the pair is near-blind and the head
--       decoder separates it.  Checked, not argued.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- SO WHAT MUST THE ANALYTIC BARRIER LEMMA SUPPLY?  Exactly one of two
-- things, and this module's content is that there is no third:
--
--   (a) EXACT agreement of the full observable, not of the blur — which
--       is `BARRIER_SMOOTH_TERM.md`'s corrected B2′ (every lower-arity
--       layer, at precision εX^{−r/2}), and is a strictly stronger
--       demand than B2 as `BARRIER.md` still states it; or
--
--   (b) a MODULUS on Φ — a bound on how far a WL post-processing may
--       amplify a sub-resolution difference.  §२'s `Respects` is the
--       weakest form of that hypothesis.
--
-- And (b) is in direct contradiction with Proposition B3 as written,
-- whose entire force is that Φ is arbitrary.  **B3's generality is what
-- kills the ε-version of its own corollary.**  That collision is the
-- finding; it is a missing distinction in the WL definition, not a
-- failure to resolve.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No analytic statement.  Nothing about ζ, about
-- admissible spectra, about L, X₀, or the depth law.  Whether WL
-- observables factor through the blur at all — the first half of item 1
-- — is untouched and remains open.  This module does not prove the
-- barrier and does not refute it; it proves that the formal half cannot
-- be applied to the analytic half at the interface the analysis
-- actually offers, and names the two repairs.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- TERM.  आसन्न — "approached", hence approximate — is the tradition's
-- own word for a value given AS an approximation and marked so in the
-- statement itself.  Āryabhaṭa, *Āryabhaṭīya*, Gaṇitapāda 10 (499):
-- the ratio 62832/20000 is introduced with आसन्नो वृत्तपरिणाहः, "this is
-- the approximate circumference" — the approximation declared in the
-- verse rather than left for a reader to discover.  That declaration is
-- the whole subject of this module: a quantity known to within a
-- tolerance is a different object from a quantity known, and a theorem
-- proved for the second does not transfer to the first.
--
-- LIMIT.  The term is used here for an arbitrary tolerance relation on
-- an answer type.  No text states a tolerance relation, Āryabhaṭa
-- proved nothing below, and the connection asserted is only that both
-- name the same job — marking, in the statement, that what is in hand
-- is near and not equal.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0 + agda/cubical, --cubical --safe, no postulates,
-- no holes.

--
-- Drop hypothesis (i) — which is exactly what `BARRIER.md` Prop. B3
-- does when it insists Φ be arbitrary and even non-computable — and
-- near-blindness implies nothing at all.
--
-- Two states.  One query.  Answers 1 and 0.  Tolerance: differ by at
-- most one.  Separation: inequality.  The pair is near-blind; the head
-- decoder tells it apart.
--
-- The tolerance here is deliberately NOT excluded by the separation
-- (adjacent naturals are within tolerance and unequal), which is
-- precisely the analytic situation: two configurations agreeing under
-- the blur have observable values that are close and different.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ५ · शेषः — what this leaves standing, and what it hands back.
--
-- Standing: `Vaidharmya` is untouched.  Over an answer type with EXACT
-- blindness the obstruction holds for any irreflexive separation and
-- any decoder whatever, and §३ re-derives it from §२.
--
-- Handed back to the analytic lane, and this is the deliverable:
-- `METHOD.md` §3 item 1 does not reduce to a formal half plus an
-- analytic half.  The analytic half must additionally produce ONE of
--
--   (a) exact layerwise agreement — B2′ of `BARRIER_SMOOTH_TERM.md`,
--       which `BARRIER.md`'s Corollary B2 does not state; or
--   (b) a modulus on WL post-processing — which `BARRIER.md`'s
--       Proposition B3 currently rules out by construction.
--
-- Until one of the two is supplied, §४ is the counterexample the claim
-- has to survive, and it is one query long.
