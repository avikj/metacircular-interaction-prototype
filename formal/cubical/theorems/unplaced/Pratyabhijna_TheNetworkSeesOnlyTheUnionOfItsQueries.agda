-- मूलवाक्यम् · the term and where it is stated.
--
--   प्रत्यभिज्ञा · pratyabhijñā — RECOGNITIVE cognition, the judgement
--   "सोऽयं देवदत्तः", *this is that same Devadatta*: the claim that a
--   thing now presented is the SAME as one presented before.  The term
--   and the stock sentence are common property of the darśanas and the
--   dispute over them is live:
--
--     · Naiyāyikas class it under pratyakṣa qualified by memory and use
--       it against momentariness.  Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, *Nyāyamañjarī*,
--       c. 9th c.; Vātsyāyana, *Nyāyabhāṣya*, c. 450, on the ātman
--       section of the *Nyāyasūtra*.
--     · Buddhist pramāṇa-vāda DENIES that it is a pramāṇa at all: the
--       two particulars are momentary and distinct, and the "same" is
--       a vikalpa laid over them.  Dharmakīrti, *Pramāṇavārttika*,
--       7th c.
--     · Utpaladeva, *Īśvarapratyabhijñākārikā*, c. 900-950, is the term
--       used as the title of a system; Abhinavagupta's *Vimarśinī*,
--       c. 1000, is its commentary.
--
--   ग्रेड · śabda, declared: no critical edition was opened for this
--   module.  Author, work and century above are reported at second
--   hand; NO sūtra or verse number is given here, because I have not
--   opened the text to fix one and a guessed number is a fabricated
--   provenance.  The row added to
--   `.claude/hooks/MulaVakya_SourceStatementsForTheTermsInOurFileNames.txt`
--   carries the same limit.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF THE SOURCE.  NOT claimed: that any of
-- these authors proved anything below, or discussed digests, networks,
-- or validators.  Claimed, and only this: the question they are
-- arguing about — *by what means, if any, is "this is that same one"
-- known?* — is exactly the question a network of validators must
-- answer about a submitted object, and the Buddhist objection (the two
-- presentations are two, and sameness is imposed) is precisely the
-- objection to letting one digest mean mathematical sameness that
-- notes/CONTENT_ADDRESSED_MATHEMATICAL_IDENTITY.md §1 states in its
-- own words.
--
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.  Two things, both short, neither new machinery.
--
-- §1  POOLING VALIDATORS ADDS NOTHING.  `QuotientFiberLaw`
--     proves that one observer with a finite query list cannot separate
--     a pair its queries are blind on.  A DECENTRALIZED network is a
--     LIST of such observers, and its pooled transcript is the
--     concatenation of theirs.  `blind-++` says blindness is closed
--     under append; `network-no-decision` therefore says: if EVERY
--     validator is blind on (x , y), then no post-processing of the
--     pooled transcript separates them — and `Separates` quantifies
--     over EVERY function `List Bool → Bool`, computable or not, so
--     "post-processing" includes every consensus rule: majority,
--     stake-weighting, reputation, a second round, an appeal.
--
--     This is the checked form of the sentence asserted but not proved
--     at notes/NATURAL_MACHINE_NETWORK_WHITEPAPER.md §10, "no consensus
--     protocol can vote a theorem true", narrowed to the case where the
--     theorem in question is an identity: is this the same as that.
--
-- §2  `sees-exactly` upgrades QuotientFiberLaw's `obs-agree` to an IFF.
--     Blindness of the whole list is EQUIVALENT to equality of
--     transcripts, so the relation a network can see is exactly the
--     kernel of `obs (pool oss)` — the word "exactly" in the law is a
--     theorem here and not an emphasis.
--
-- §3  ABHIJÑĀNA — which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound, for a digest.
--     Bind `b`: `Σ[ b ] (f a ≡ b)` is contractible, so "what is the
--     address of this object" needs no consensus and never disagrees.
--     Bind `a`: `Address b = Σ[ a ] (f a ≡ b)` is the PREIMAGE and is
--     arbitrary.  Content addressing is the assertion that THIS fibre
--     is contractible, and `addressed` decomposes that assertion into
--     its two independent halves: `Address b` inhabited is
--     AVAILABILITY, `isProp (Address b)` is COLLISION-FREEDOM.  Neither
--     implies the other and their conjunction is exactly `isContr`.
--
--     The empty / one / many trichotomy this exposes is NOT graded here
--     — notes/SakalaVikalaDesa_TheFibreIsTheLossAndAnEmptyFibreIsAvakta
--     vyamNotNasti.md already grades it in five levels and shows that
--     `isContr`'s two-valued verdict merges the two ENDS.  This module
--     supplies only the network instance of its rows ० and १.
