-- AFigureWithoutItsInputDecidesNothing
--
-- `interactive/ObstructionCensus.hs` prints published figures next to
-- recomputed ones as a regression guard, and then says exactly why that
-- guard is weaker than it looks:
--
--   "a disagreement between a bracket and its number is not evidence of
--    a regression in `triage`, it is evidence that the log moved …
--    a count without its input is the same defect as a constant without
--    its scaling."
--
-- Its input, `interactive/machine.log`, is excluded by `.gitignore:16` — no
-- clone has it, no reader reproduces it, and it grows whenever the
-- engine runs.  §2 is that sentence as a theorem, and §3 is the exact
-- amount the guard recovers once the input IS shared, which is less than
-- one might assume.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT
--
-- NOT a criticism of that module.  It states the defect itself, in its
-- own comment, and prints the input's identity and line count first
-- precisely so a figure is quotable at all.  This module supplies the
-- statement it is already acting on.
--
-- NOT the container-versus-pin finding again
-- (`notes/MY_GREENS_THIS_SESSION_ARE_CONTAINER_GREENS.md`).  That was
-- about which TOOLCHAIN produced an exit code.  This is about an INPUT
-- the reader does not have, which is a different failure: there the
-- verifier was wrong, here the verifier is fine and the datum is
-- private.
--
-- NOT a claim that untracked inputs should be tracked.  A log that grows
-- on every run is not obviously a repository artefact, and nothing below
-- says what to do about it.
--
-- CHECKED on the CONTAINER (Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — NOT the declared
-- pin, Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9).  --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- 4.  The reading
--
-- §2: an untracked input makes the published-versus-recomputed
-- comparison uninformative in BOTH directions, which is stronger than
-- "the guard is weak" — it is not a guard at all.
--
-- §3: sharing the input buys a one-sided test.  Mismatch refutes;
-- match establishes nothing.  That is the correct shape for a regression
-- guard and it is worth saying, because the natural summary — "the
-- numbers agree, so nothing changed" — is the half §3's second theorem
-- refutes.
--
-- Both halves are about the same object the census module already names:
-- the input.  Its own remedy, printing the input's identity and line
-- count before any figure, is exactly what moves a report from §2 to §3.
