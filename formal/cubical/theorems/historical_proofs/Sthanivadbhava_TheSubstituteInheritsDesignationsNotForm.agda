-- स्थानिवद्भावः — Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.1.56, and लोपः — 1.1.60, 1.1.62.
--
-- THE SŪTRAS, in the vulgate text and numbering.
--
--   1.1.56  स्थानिवदादेशोऽनल्विधौ   sthānivad ādeśo 'nalvidhau
--           An ādeśa (substitute) is like the sthānin (the original it
--           stands in place of) — EXCEPT in an al-vidhi, an operation
--           conditioned on the sounds (aL is the pratyāhāra of the whole
--           inventory).  So the substitute inherits the original's
--           designations and not its form.
--
--   1.1.60  अदर्शनं लोपः            adarśanaṃ lopaḥ
--           Lopa is NON-APPEARANCE.
--
--   1.1.62  प्रत्ययलोपे प्रत्ययलक्षणम्  pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam
--           When an affix is elided, the operations conditioned by that
--           affix still apply.
--
--   1.3.9   तस्य लोपः               tasya lopaḥ
--           The it-marker is elided (having, by 1.3.2–1.3.8, done its
--           marking).
--
--   1.1.5   क्ङिति च                 kṅiti ca
--           No guṇa or vṛddhi when the affix is marked with k or ṅ — a
--           marking 1.3.9 erased before this rule is consulted.
--
-- Pāṇini, ~500 BCE; Kātyāyana's vārttikas ~250 BCE; Patañjali's
-- Mahābhāṣya ~150 BCE.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED, and it is four statements, not a gloss.
--
--   anal-blind        A rule that reads only the designations gives the
--                     same answer on an ādeśa and on its sthānin.  For
--                     EVERY such rule, into EVERY type, with no case
--                     analysis: the proof is that the rule factors
--                     through the designation and the ādeśa preserves
--                     it.  That is representation independence, and it
--                     is the half of 1.1.56 that holds.
--
--   ec?-not-anal      The half that does not.  6.1.78 eco 'yavāyāvaḥ
--                     asks whether the sound is in eC, and there is
--                     provably NO function of the designations that
--                     agrees with it — so 6.1.78 is not blind, cannot be
--                     made blind, and is exactly what `anal-vidhau`
--                     excepts.  The barrier is not leaky by oversight.
--
--   one-reading-fails No single reading serves both.  If one function
--                     from varṇas to forms satisfies the al-vidhi's
--                     requirement and the anal-vidhi's, the two forms
--                     are equal, and here they are not.  So the grammar
--                     needs the rule-indexed reading it has; a
--                     transparency setting is not enough, and neither is
--                     an opacity setting.
--
--   lopa-load-bearing The elided varṇa is absent from the surface and
--                     present to the conditions.  Two derivations with
--                     the same appearance differ in what 1.1.5 reads,
--                     so deletion and non-appearance are not the same
--                     operation.
--
-- THE WITNESSES ARE NOT INVENTED.  They are what `machine/Astadhyayi.hs`
-- computes.  `nī ~ lyuṭ` derives `nayana`, and its `barrierAudit` prints
--
--     6.1.78 is conditioned on the sounds, so it read the ādeśa e and
--     not the sthānin ī
--
-- because 7.3.84 had put `e` in place of `ī`.  And `ci ~ kta` derives
-- `cita` because 1.1.5 reads the `k` that 1.3.9 erased; make lopa a
-- deletion (`deriveWithoutLopa`) and it gives `ceta`.
--
-- CORRECTED 2026-08-20, when the engine side was spliced in and the
-- claims became checkable.  This paragraph previously predicted what
-- striking `anal-vidhau` (`deriveSthanivatEverywhere`) would give:
-- `neana` for nī ~ lyuṭ, `vāj` for vāc, `tadjalam` for tat + jalam.
-- All three are wrong, and the machine's answers are sharper than the
-- guesses were:
--
--   nī ~ lyuṭ   nayana → neyu.  7.3.84 reads the ī it has itself just
--               replaced, re-offers the SAME guṇa, the offer is a no-op,
--               and the engine reads that as a fixpoint and halts three
--               rules early.  A guṇa rule that counts its own output as
--               the sthānin cannot tell that it has fired -- so without
--               the clause the derivation ends in the wrong PLACE, not
--               merely with the wrong sound.
--   tat + ca    tacca → tajca.  8.4.40 keeps reading the t that 8.2.39
--               replaced.
--   rāmas       rāmaḥ → rāmar.  8.3.15 reads the s it was given in place
--               of, so its `r` condition is never met.
--   vāc         vāk → vāk, in FIVE steps rather than three: 8.2.39 cycles
--               k → j → g and 8.4.56 cycles g → c → k, and the cycle lands
--               back on the attested form.  Same word, different
--               derivation -- a test on the form alone would have called
--               this agreement.
--   tat + jalam tajjalam → tajjalam, unchanged.
--
-- The prediction was made before the mechanism existed and was not
-- marked as one.  It is kept here, struck and corrected, rather than
-- edited away.
--
-- ONE MODELLING CHOICE, STATED.  1.1.56 is an atideśa -- it EXTENDS the
-- sthānin's properties to the ādeśa.  Here that is rendered as a READING:
-- `drsta anal` hands a rule the sthānin's form, `drsta al` the ādeśa's.
-- That is one way to make "counts as the sthānin" operational and not the
-- only one; what it buys is that the exception clause becomes a switch
-- whose cost can be measured, and what it costs is that an extension of a
-- property is rendered as a substitution on the input.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  1.1.52–1.1.55, which say WHICH sound of the
-- sthānin an ādeśa replaces, are not here; nor the vārttikas that
-- restrict 1.1.56 further; nor 1.1.61/1.1.63, which single out luk, ślu
-- and lup and give them their own sthānivadbhāva treatment.  The
-- forms below are the three that the encoded derivation passes through
-- and no more — the same choice, and the same reason, as
-- `Asiddhatva.agda`'s three-element carrier.
--
-- PRIOR ART, searched before writing.  That sthānivadbhāva has the shape
-- of an abstraction barrier is stated in this repository's own
-- reading came from and which flags it as unimplemented; the reading of
-- 1.1.56 as opacity-with-an-exception is standard in the commentarial
-- literature (the Kāśikā's treatment of anal-vidhi; Kiparsky on the
-- architecture of the grammar).  What is here is the mechanisation and
-- the impossibility half — that no designation-function agrees with an
-- al-vidhi, and that no single reading serves both — which I did not
-- find stated, and which is cheap enough that if it is stated somewhere
-- I did not reach, this is a re-derivation and the citation is owed.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.

-- OBSERVE, and neither is a statement about what the form is.  §2 is the
-- first as a factorisation theorem; §5–6 is the second as a separation.
--
-- The engine in machine/Astadhyayi.hs runs on exactly this, and the
-- correspondence is stated with the engine's own names (checked against
-- it 2026-08-20, when the engine side was written):
--
--   `Varna` here          → there the item and a PARALLEL channel `Prov`,
