-- BhavanaSemiring — Brahmagupta's composition law over ℕ, proved.
--
-- BRAHMAGUPTA, Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, 628 CE, ch. 18, the rule called
-- bhāvanā ("production", "composition"):
--
--     (x₁² − D y₁²)(x₂² − D y₂²)
--        = (x₁x₂ + D y₁y₂)² − D(x₁y₂ + x₂y₁)²
--
-- the multiplicativity of the norm form N(x,y) = x² − D y².  `Bhavana.agda`
-- carries it over ℤ.  This file is about ℕ, and about a fact that is not a
-- restatement of Brahmagupta but a consequence of putting him in a place he
-- was not working in.
--
-- BHĀVANĀ AS STATED IS FALSE OVER ℕ.  Monus is truncated: where both true
-- norms are negative, each side flattens to 0 and the identity fails.  The
-- witness, found by exhaustive search in historical/machine-runs/thoughts.bhavana.math, is
-- (x₁,y₁,x₂,y₂) = (0,1,0,1): the true norms are (−1,−1) at D = 1, so the
-- left side is 0 ∸ 0 = 0 while the right side is 1.
--
-- The repair is the one this repository uses everywhere for denominators —
-- clear the offending operation instead of restricting the domain.  Move
-- every negative term across.  With cx = x₁x₂ + D y₁y₂ and
-- cy = x₁y₂ + x₂y₁, bhāvanā becomes, subtraction-free:
--
--     cx² + D x₁² y₂² + D x₂² y₁²  =  x₁² x₂² + D² y₁² y₂² + D cy²
--
-- Over ℤ that is bhāvanā, by adding the same two terms to both sides.  Over
-- ℕ it is true with NO hypothesis and no monus at all.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  That statement was verified on 28561 points at
-- D = 1 and D = 2, zero failures.  Exhaustive checking of a *bounded box* is
-- not a proof of a statement quantified over all of ℕ — CLAUDE.md is explicit
-- that a finite exhaustive verification is proof only of what it exhausts.
-- The identity is in fact a commutative-semiring identity: expanding both
-- sides gives the same five monomials, with the cross term 2D x₁x₂y₁y₂
-- appearing once on each side.  So it needs no induction, no ordering, and
-- no subtraction — it holds in ANY commutative semiring, and ℕ is one.
--
-- 28561 points become ∀ x₁ y₁ x₂ y₂ : ℕ.
