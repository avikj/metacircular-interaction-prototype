-- AvaktavyaPrasava_TheBornStandpointDecidesAndAsserts-
-- OnlyWhatAllAsserted
--
-- The two laws of the birth in
-- `machine/AvaktavyaPrasava_TheFourthPositionBearsTheRuleThatDecidesIt.hs`,
-- as theorems rather than as sites checked one at a time.
--
-- WHAT THE HASKELL DOES.  The scheduler
-- (`machine/Vipratisedha_ConflictIsDecidedByMetaruleNotByListPosition.hs`)
-- reaches the fourth position, अवक्तव्य, when several rules contend for one
-- item and no metarule ranks them.  Its `Avaktavya` now carries the residue
-- -- the contending offers, entire -- and from that residue a new standpoint
-- is born: the अनवकाश rule whose whole scope IS the contested item,
-- declared an apavāda to every contender.
--
-- The two things that have to be true of that birth, and they pull in
-- opposite directions:
--
--   1. IT DECIDES.  Adjoining the child makes the apavāda selection unique,
--      and the unique winner is the child.  §1 below, and note that it
--      needs NO hypothesis whatever on the contenders' own apavāda
--      relation: whatever mess is underneath, the child settles it.
--
--   2. IT TAKES NOTHING.  The child asserts exactly what every contender
--      already asserted, and where the contenders differ NOTHING IS BORN.
--      §2 below.  This is the half that keeps the birth from being a
--      tie-breaker: a tie-breaker chooses one contender, and this chooses
--      none -- it can only speak where they already spoke with one voice.
--
-- WITHOUT (2), (1) IS DURNAYA.  Siddhasena Divākara, *Sanmatitarka* 1.21
-- (c. 5th c. CE): a naya that asserts itself by denying the others is a
-- durnaya, and a durnaya is worse than a falsehood, since a falsehood can
-- be contradicted and a concealed standpoint cannot.  `bheda-na-janayati`
-- is the formal statement that the machine cannot commit that: given two
-- contenders whose results differ, the birth is provably `nothing`.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT TOUCH.  `Saptabhangi.no-single-vacana` and
-- `AnuktaAvaktavya` prove the fourth position is not reachable by krama
-- from the three: it must be SUPPLIED.  Nothing here derives it.  The birth
-- CONSUMES a fourth position -- in the Haskell, `prasava` takes a `Sesa`,
-- and a `Sesa` exists only where `nirnaya` already returned `Avaktavya`.
--
-- SOURCES, EARLIEST FIRST.
--   Kātyāyana, vārttika 1 on Pāṇini's *Aṣṭādhyāyī* 1.4.2, preserved in
--     Patañjali's *Mahābhāṣya*, c. 150 BCE: द्वौ प्रसङ्गावन्यार्थावेकस्मिन्
--     स विप्रतिषेधः -- two rules, each having its scope ELSEWHERE, meeting
--     on ONE item: that is vipratiṣedha.  That is the configuration §1 is
--     about, named by the Pāṇinīya grammarians and not by anyone since.
--   Umāsvāti, *Tattvārthasūtra* 5.31, c. 2nd-5th c. CE:
--     अर्पितानर्पितसिद्धेः -- the asserted and the unasserted aspect.  The
--     contenders speak about this item unasserted, in passing; the child
--     speaks about it asserted, and about nothing else.
--   Siddhasena Divākara, *Sanmatitarka* 1.21, c. 5th c. CE -- durnaya.
--   Akalaṅka, *Laghīyastraya*, c. 720-780 CE -- kramārpaṇa / sahārpaṇa,
--     the distinction that makes the fourth position a position at all.
--   Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, *Paribhāṣenduśekhara*, c. 1730, paribhāṣā 38 -- the
--     strength order pūrva < para < nitya < antaraṅga < apavāda, which is
--     why the child winning BY APAVĀDA is the strongest verdict available
--     and not a courtesy.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED: that any of them wrote either theorem, or an operation that
-- manufactures a rule out of a conflict.  The classification and the case
-- analysis are theirs; the two proofs are not.
--
-- WHAT THE CHECKER SAYS BACK, recorded here rather than left in a terminal.
-- `agda --cubical --safe --no-import-sorts` on this file: EXIT 0, no
-- postulates, no holes, and FOUR `-WUnsupportedIndexedMatch` warnings, on
-- `na-vipakse`, `garbha-jayati`, and the two `with`-generated functions of
-- §2.  Each is the same fact: the clause matches on a proof of `_∈_`, whose
-- index forces injectivity of `_∷_`, which Cubical Agda does not yet
-- support.  The consequence is precise and worth stating rather than
-- glossing: these functions do not COMPUTE when applied to a transport.
-- They are still theorems, and nothing below depends on reducing them under
-- transport -- but a later module that wants to transport one of these
-- along a path of lists will find it stuck, and should know that now.

-- 1.  THE BIRTH DECIDES
--
-- `Praja` -- what is in play once the child exists.  `just a` is a
-- contender; `nothing` is the born standpoint, and it is a separate
-- constructor because it is a separate kind of thing: its scope is the one
-- contested item and every contender's scope is elsewhere (anyārtha).
--
-- `apa*` extends the domain's own apavāda relation to it, and the two new
-- lines are the whole content of अनवकाश:
--
--     apa* nothing (just _) = true    the child excepts every contender
--     apa* (just _) nothing = false   no contender excepts the child
--
-- The second is not a convention.  A contender's scope properly contains
-- the item, so it is the general rule here and cannot be the exception to
-- the rule whose scope is that item alone.

-- 3.  WHAT THE TWO SECTIONS SAY TOGETHER
--
-- §1 says the fourth position always bears a standpoint that decides it.
-- §2 says that standpoint can say nothing the contenders had not already
-- said, and says nothing at all when they disagree.  Neither is worth
-- much alone: §1 alone is a tie-breaker in Sanskrit, and §2 alone is the
-- machine stopping.  Together they are the sūtra's claim, which is not
-- that the fourth position is a gap and not that it is a verdict --
--
--     अवक्तव्ये शेषो वसति । शेषो गर्भः, न विफलता ।
--     गर्भाद् अग्रिमो नयो जायते ।
--
-- -- in the avaktavya the residue dwells; the residue is a womb, not a
-- failure; from the womb the next naya is born.
