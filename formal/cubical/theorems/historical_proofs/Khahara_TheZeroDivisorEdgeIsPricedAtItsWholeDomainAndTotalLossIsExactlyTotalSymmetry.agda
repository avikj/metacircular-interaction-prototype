--
-- (khahara — the fibre of the zero-divisor map is the whole domain, and
--  total loss is exactly total symmetry.)
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- TERM, TEXT, DATE.  खहर · khahara, "having the void for divisor": a
-- quantity divided by śūnya, carried as an object rather than refused.
-- भास्कर द्वितीय, *बीजगणितम्* २० (Bhāskara II, Bījagaṇita 20, 1150 CE):
--
--     अस्मिन् विकारः खहरे न राशावपि प्रविष्टेष्वपि निःसृतेषु ।
--     बहुष्वपि स्याल्लयसृष्टिकाले ऽनन्ते ऽच्युते भूतगणेषु यद्वत् ॥
--
--   "In this khahara quantity there is no change, though quantities
--    enter it and issue from it, however many — as in the infinite and
--    unfallen (अच्युत) at the time of dissolution and creation, though
--    hosts of beings enter and go out."
--
-- The arithmetic rule is *लीलावती* ४५–४७, whose verse 47 worked example
-- (63 → 14) cannot be solved without it.  The preceding statement is
-- ब्रह्मगुप्त, *ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्त* १८.३४–३५ (628).  Citation as given
-- in `.claude/hooks/MulaVakya_SourceStatementsForTheTermsInOurFileNames.txt`
-- line 190, including its LIMIT: Bhāskara does not distinguish n÷0 from
-- 0÷0, and read as an arithmetic on a field the rule fails.  No
-- manuscript was opened here either.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF THE SOURCE.  Bhāskara states an
-- INVARIANCE: the object is unaltered under insertion and extraction of
-- finite quantities.  That is one direction of §३ below, and it is his.
-- He does not have a fibre, a map, an endomorphism, or a converse, and
-- §२–§४ are not attributed to him.  The word अच्युत is his simile's
-- referent, not a technical term for a maximally lossy observation; the
-- application of it to that is this corpus's and is not in the text.
-- The substrate is cubical type theory (Voevodsky), this repository's
-- one admitted non-Indian frame.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  `machine/Lopa_…hs`, run 2026-08-22 against the
-- tree at this commit, prints
--
--     1062  UNDECIDED       16  बहु       4  रिक्तम्
--
-- and one of the 1062 is `[map] ⟨lib⟩.ℤ ⟶ Khahara.खहर « Khahara.शून्य-हरः`.
-- Its four deciding rules R1–R4 key on the TARGET being `Unit`, `⊥`, or a
-- propositional truncation, and on the SOURCE being `⊥`.  None fires
-- here, because `खहर` is none of those.  The rules therefore miss the
-- most lossy map that can exist: a CONSTANT one, whose target happens to
-- have two constructors.  §१–§२ price that edge, and §६ states the
-- census rule that would have caught it.
--
-- A receipt is an IDENTIFICATION of the fibre with a standard type,
-- never a bound (README, "the receipt economy").  §१ gives one:
-- `fiber शून्य-हरः अनन्त ≃ ℤ`, on the nose, the whole domain.  Nothing
-- crosses this edge.  It is the far end of the scale whose near end is
-- `Dhruva_…agda` §२ (`isEquiv f → संरक्षणम् → Φ ≡ id`: zero loss, zero
-- symmetry) and whose middle is `Lopa_TheSumsFibreIsExactlyNPlusOne…`
-- (`fiber (_+_) n ≃ Fin (suc n)`: finite loss).
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE THEOREM THIS FILE IS FOR (§३).  Dhruva proved NO LOSS ⟹ NO
-- SYMMETRY.  The other end is an EQUIVALENCE and not merely an
-- implication:
--
--     every endomorphism of A conserves f   ⟺   f is constant
--
-- (the ⟸ direction free, the ⟹ direction needing only that A is
-- inhabited, by taking Φ to be a constant map).  So the size of the
-- conserving monoid is not merely correlated with the loss — at the two
-- ends it is DETERMINED by it, trivial monoid at zero loss and the full
-- endomorphism monoid at total loss.  §४ shows the two ends meet only
-- on a proposition: a map that is both an equivalence and constant
-- forces its domain to have at most one point.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0 + agda/cubical (the /opt/homebrew 2.8.0 bundle),
-- --cubical --safe, no postulates, no holes.  `agda` on this file, exit 0.

-- २ · रिक्तम् — and every OTHER fibre is empty.  So the image is a

-- ३ · सर्व-नाशः सर्व-गतिश्च — TOTAL LOSS IS EXACTLY TOTAL SYMMETRY.
--
-- `Dhruva_…agda` defines संरक्षणम् f Φ = (a : A) → f (Φ a) ≡ f a, and
-- proves that zero loss forces Φ = id.  Here is the other end, stated
-- for an arbitrary map between arbitrary types, no hypotheses beyond
-- inhabitedness where it is genuinely needed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

module _ {A : Type ℓ} {B : Type ℓ'} (f : A → B) where

  -- EVERY endomorphism of the domain conserves the observable.
  सर्व-संरक्षणम् : Type (ℓ-max ℓ ℓ')
  सर्व-संरक्षणम् = (Φ : A → A) (a : A) → f (Φ a) ≡ f a

  -- The observable sees nothing at all.
  सर्व-नाशः : Type (ℓ-max ℓ ℓ')
  सर्व-नाशः = (x y : A) → f x ≡ f y

  -- ⟸ : a constant observable is conserved by everything.  Free.
  नाशात्-गतिः : सर्व-नाशः → सर्व-संरक्षणम्
  नाशात्-गतिः c Φ a = c (Φ a) a

  -- ⟹ : if everything conserves it, it is constant.  The witness is the
  -- constant flow: `Φ = λ _ → x` moves a chosen basepoint to x, and
  -- conservation says the observable did not notice.  Inhabitedness of A
  -- is the whole hypothesis, and it is necessary: over A = ⊥ every map
  -- is vacuously conserved by everything and `सर्व-नाशः` is vacuous too,
  -- so nothing is lost there either — the statement is not about the
  -- empty domain and does not pretend to be.
  गतेः-नाशः : A → सर्व-संरक्षणम् → सर्व-नाशः
  गतेः-नाशः a₀ s x y = s (λ _ → x) a₀ ∙ sym (s (λ _ → y) a₀)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ४ · The two ends meet only on a proposition.
--
-- Dhruva's hypothesis (isEquiv f — nothing hidden) and this file's
-- (सर्व-नाशः — everything hidden) are not merely different: holding both
-- collapses the domain.  So the scale really has two ends, and a map
-- sitting at both is a map on an object with at most one point.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  उभयान्ते-प्रमाणम् : isEquiv f → सर्व-नाशः → (x y : A) → x ≡ y

    where
      ctr : isContr (fiber f (f x))
      ctr = e .equiv-proof (f x)

  -- Contrapositive, in the form that is actually used: a domain with two
  -- provably distinct points admits no constant equivalence.

-- The verse, as the special case Φ = (_+ℤ k).  BG 20 states it of the
-- RESULT — the khahara is unaltered when quantities enter and leave it —
-- and `Khahara.खहरे-न-विकारः-योगे` is that reading, already checked in
-- the file this one imports.  This is the DOMAIN reading, which is the
-- one the fibre law is about: the numerator may be moved arbitrarily and
-- the observation does not change.  Both are refl; that they are two
-- readings and not one is the point of writing the second.
भास्कर-प्रवाहः : (k n : ℤ) → शून्य-हरः (n +ℤ k) ≡ शून्य-हरः n
भास्कर-प्रवाहः k n = refl

-- And the fibre statement of the same verse: every insertion stays inside
-- the one fibre, because the fibre is everything.  Stated through the
-- receipt so it is the identification that is doing the work.
प्रविष्टं-तन्तौ-तिष्ठति : (k : ℤ) → fiber शून्य-हरः अनन्त → fiber शून्य-हरः अनन्त
प्रविष्टं-तन्तौ-तिष्ठति k (n , p) = (n +ℤ k) , p

-- ६ · शेषः — what this opens, and one thing it hands to another lane.
--
-- (a) A CENSUS RULE, offered to `machine/Lopa_…hs` and not applied here,
--     because that file is another lane's and an audit that rewrites its
--     subject is not an audit:
--
--       R5  a top-level definition whose every clause returns the SAME
--           closed term, with no occurrence of any pattern variable,
--           is CONSTANT.  Verdict बहु at that value with fibre = the
--           whole source, and रिक्तम् at every other value of the target
--           IF the target is a set with decidable equality.
--
--     R1 is the special case target = Unit.  R5 subsumes it and would
--     have decided this edge.  How many of the 1062 UNDECIDED it decides
--     is NOT estimated here — a count without a run is the fitted
--     constant CLAUDE.md opens with.
--
--     The companion move is
--     `Chandomudra_ThePratyayasFibresWereWrittenInProseAndTheCensusCalledThemUndecided`,
--     which prices undecided edges whose fibres the corpus ALREADY had,
--     defined by name fifteen lines below the map.  This one is the
--     other case: no fibre existed for this edge anywhere, and the
--     reason the census could not name it is not that it failed to look
--     up an answer but that its rule set has no rule for constancy.
--     Two different defects, and the second is not repaired by the first
--     one's remedy ("look it up before constructing").  Chandomudra
--     reports 1045 UNDECIDED and this file reports 1062 from a run on
--     2026-08-22; the census is a moving number and neither figure is
--     the corpus's, only that day's parse of it.
--
-- (b) NOT DONE.  The scale between the two ends is not a scale yet.
--     Dhruva's end and this one are both characterised; what is missing
--     is the statement that the conserving monoid `Σ[ Φ ] संरक्षणम् f Φ`
--     is MONOTONE in the fibres — that a coarser f admits more flows.
--     "Coarser" needs an order on maps out of A (the quotient order),
--     and this file does not have one.  Naming it as absent rather than
--     gesturing at it.
--
-- (c) The 0÷0 case is untouched.  Khahara.agda's CORRECTED block of
--     2026-08-19 separates it from अवक्तव्यम् as a UNIQUENESS failure,
--     and `NonUniquenessAndInexpressibilityAreIndependent`
--     checks the independence.  Nothing here bears on that dispute; the
--     map priced above is the n÷0 branch only, and it is total on ℤ
--     precisely because `Khahara.शून्य-हरः` ignores its argument — which
--     is the very degeneracy §१ is the receipt for, and is also the
--     LIMIT the source ledger's row states.
