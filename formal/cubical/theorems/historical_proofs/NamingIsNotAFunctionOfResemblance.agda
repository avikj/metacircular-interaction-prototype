-- NamingIsNotAFunctionOfResemblance
--
-- `machine/Upamana.hs` states an operative test and builds its whole
-- design on it.  The test's core is checkable, and this is it: no
-- invariant of the resemblance relation computes the naming.  So a
-- similarity cannot be DERIVED into a naming — it has to come from
-- somewhere else, which is exactly why that module keeps its stated
-- similarities as INPUT and quarantines the derived ones.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE SCHOOLS, NAMED BEFORE THEIR TERMS, AND THE DISPUTE NOT ADJUDICATED
--
-- NYYA (Gautama, *Nyyastra* 1.1.6; Vtsyyana's *Nyyabhya* on it,
-- c. 400–450 CE) holds upamāna — knowledge from similarity to what is
-- already well known — to be a separate pramāṇa, and Vātsyāyana fixes
-- its result as *saj-saji-sambandha-pratipatti*: apprehension of
-- the relation between a NAME and its BEARER.  The argument for
-- irreducibility, sharpened by Gagea (*Tattvacintmai*,
-- upamna-khaa, c. 1325): to INFER "this is a gavaya" you would need
-- the pervasion "whatever resembles a cow thus is denoted by 'gavaya'",
-- which is precisely what is being learned — the pervasion is the
-- conclusion and so cannot be the premise.
--
-- BUDDHIST (Dignga, *Pramasamuccaya* 1.2, c. 500: two pramas only;
-- Dharmakrti, *Pramavrttika*) DENIES the separateness and analyses
-- upamna into testimony, memory, perception and inference.  MMS
-- (abara; Kumrila, *lokavrttika*, upamna-pariccheda, c. 650)
-- accepts it but REVERSES it — the new cognition is of the remembered
-- cow.  Vaieika and Skhya reduce it to anumna.
--
-- ★ WHAT §2 DOES AND DOES NOT SETTLE, and this is the whole point.
-- It shows the naming is not a function of the resemblance.  That is
-- what BOTH sides need and NEITHER side's conclusion.  The Naiyyika
-- reads it as: therefore a distinct instrument, sdya-jna, supplies
-- the naming.  Dignga reads it as: therefore the forester's SENTENCE
-- supplies it — śabda plus memory, no new pramāṇa.  The theorem is
-- neutral between them because it only says the naming comes from
-- OUTSIDE the resemblance, and both accounts agree on that and disagree
-- on what the outside is.  Agreement in verdict does not license
-- collapsing the grounds, so neither is adjudicated here.
--
-- SOURCING.  Every attribution above
-- is carried from `machine/Upamana.hs`, which sources and dates them in
-- its §0.

-- 3.  What this earns for `machine/Upamana.hs`
--
-- That module quarantines DERIVED similarities from STATED ones and says
-- the quarantine is what stops anumna being laundered as upamna.  §2
-- is why the quarantine is not bookkeeping: a naming is not recoverable
-- from resemblance data by any function whatever, so a derived
-- similarity cannot become a naming without something else being
-- supplied.  Whether that something is a distinct prama (Nyya) or
-- testimony plus memory (Dignga) is not decided here and §0 says why.
