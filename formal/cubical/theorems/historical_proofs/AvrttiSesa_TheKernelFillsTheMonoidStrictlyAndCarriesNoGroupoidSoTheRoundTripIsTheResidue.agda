-- TERM.  आवृत्ति (āvṛtti), repetition / a turning back over the same
-- ground, and शेष (śeṣa), what is left over.  Both are used in their
-- ordinary technical senses and NO SŪTRA IS CLAIMED for anything proved
-- here.  शेष in the sense this file uses — the remainder is kept and is
-- the material of the next step — is Āryabhaṭa, Āryabhaṭīya, गणितपाद
-- 32–33 (499 CE), the kuṭṭaka; the mathematics below is not his and the
-- header says so rather than borrowing his authority for it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS SETTLES, and it was previously settled only by a length.
--
-- Three files in this repository state one fact about the kernel and
-- none of them cites another:
--
--   Yantra_…            the computer is a GROUPOID: `A ≃ A` fills the
--                       monoid interface AND the inverse field, and every
--                       law holds by `equivEq refl` — strictly.
--   Avirodha_…          the kernel is "strictly a category, weakly a
--                       groupoid", and "the gap between the two is the
--                       śeṣa" — but the weakness is exhibited only by
--                       `the-round-trip-is-not-nothing`, an observation
--                       about `len`, not a statement in the path type.
--   Asesa_…             `Meaning a b` is a PROPOSITION, so the fibre of
--                       soundness over any meaning is the WHOLE
--                       derivation type, and soundness is refutably not
--                       an equivalence at the kernel's own seed.
--
-- A remark about `len` is weaker than it looks: `len` is a function of
-- the derivation, so "the round trip has positive length" leaves open
-- that SOME OTHER inverse — not `rev` — might close it on the nose.
-- §3 removes that.  It quantifies over every function whatsoever:
--
--     the-kernel-carries-no-inverse :
--       (inv : Derivation A A → Derivation A A)
--       → ((d : Derivation A A) → d ⊕ inv d ≡ done A) → ⊥
--
-- so the failure is a property OF THE KERNEL'S COMPOSITION, not a defect
-- of the particular `rev` that Avirodha_ happens to define.
--
-- §4 puts the two sides on ONE interface, `MonoidMachine` imported from
-- `Yantra_…` rather than restated, so the comparison is between the same
-- record and not between two spellings of it:
--
--     equivalences-carry-an-inverse : (A : Type ℓ) → GroupoidOver (एकत्वम् A)
--     the-kernel-carries-none       : ¬ GroupoidOver आवृत्तिः
--
-- SAME INTERFACE.  One side fills it; the other provably cannot.  That
-- difference is the whole of what the kernel keeps and `_≃_` throws away,
-- and by `Asesa_…` it is invisible to meaning: the two derivations that
-- separate the fibre have EQUAL meanings, because the meaning type is a
-- proposition and has no two positions in it.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  No braiding.  A groupoid whose inverse fails
-- to be strict is not thereby a braid group action:
-- `BraidCoherenceBoundary` exhibits two involutive
-- self-EQUIVALENCES of `Bool × Bool × Bool` that fail Yang–Baxter at
-- (false , false , false), so invertibility does not entail the
-- coherence, and nothing here supplies it.  No thermodynamics, no
-- physical implementation, no measure, no heat — `Yantra_…` carries a
-- correction inset about exactly that overclaim and this file does not
-- reinstate it.

-- §1  THE INVERSE, AS A STRUCTURE OVER A GIVEN MONOID.
--
-- Not a fresh record.  `Yantra_…`'s `GroupoidMachine` bundles its monoid
-- as a field, which makes "does THIS monoid admit an inverse?" awkward to
-- ask.  Asking it is the whole business here, so the inverse is indexed
-- by the monoid it would extend.

-- §5  WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS.
--
-- `_≃_` composes and inverts and keeps nothing: `invEquiv-is-rinv` says
-- the round trip IS the no-op, on the nose, so an equivalence groupoid
-- cannot record that a route was taken.  `Derivation` composes and cannot
-- invert: every route it takes is still in the term, and §3 says no
-- function can remove it.
--
-- That surplus is exactly the object `Asesa_…` shows the semantics cannot
-- see.  `Meaning a b` is a proposition; the fibre of soundness over any
-- meaning is the whole derivation type; the two routes that separate it
-- have equal meanings by `isSetℕ`.  So the kernel carries a distinction
-- that is real in the term, invisible in the value, and — by §3 —
-- irremovable by any post-processing of the term.
--
-- The interface consequence, stated because it is mechanical and not a
-- reading: a wire that returns the MEANING returns the part that is
-- provably a proposition, and a wire that does not return the DERIVATION
-- drops the part that is provably everything.
