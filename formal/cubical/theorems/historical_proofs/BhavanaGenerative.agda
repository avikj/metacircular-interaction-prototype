-- BhavanaGenerative — bhāvanā as an OPERATION, not an identity.
--
-- BRAHMAGUPTA, Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, 628 CE, chapter 18.  The rule is
-- called *bhāvanā*: "production", "bringing into being".  The name is the
-- claim.  It is not called "the multiplicativity of the norm form"; it is
-- called production, because what Brahmagupta states is that from two
-- solutions you MAKE a third.
--
-- WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE AND WHY IT WAS HALF THE RULE.  `Bhavana.agda` proves
--
--     N D a₁ b₁ · N D a₂ b₂ ≡ N D (bhA …) (bhB …)
--
-- over an arbitrary commutative ring, and `BhavanaSemiring.agda` proves the
-- subtraction-free form over ℕ.  Both are true and neither produces
-- anything.  They are equations between coordinates.  A reader holding two
-- solutions of x² − D y² = k must still assemble the third by hand and
-- discharge its norm obligation by hand, and nothing in the development
-- stops them assembling it wrongly.  Six centuries of cakravāla stand on
-- bhāvanā being a MOVE.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE ADDS.  The move, typed:
--
--     _⊛_ : Sol D k₁ → Sol D k₂ → Sol D (k₁ · k₂)
--
-- Read the type as the theorem.  It says composition of solutions exists and
-- that the norm multiplies, and it says so in the only place that cannot rot:
-- the obligation travels WITH the pair, so a composite that does not satisfy
-- its equation is not expressible.  The identity in `Bhavana.agda` is what
-- pays for the type; having been paid, the caller turns a handle.
--
-- The unit-norm solutions are then closed under the operation, and iterating
-- from a single seed gives an ℕ-indexed family — which is the generativity
-- the 628 rule is named for and which no file here had.
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY.  That the family is INJECTIVE.  Over an arbitrary
-- commutative ring it is not (take a finite ring), so distinctness is not a
-- consequence of anything below and is not asserted.  It is a statement about
-- growth in an ordered ring and it is left open here rather than waved at.
-- What is exhibited instead, at the end, is the first stretch of the D = 2
-- chain over ℤ with its members computed, their norms checked, and their
-- pairwise DISEQUALITIES proved as terms — a fact about D = 2, not a theorem
-- about the construction.  (Until 2026-08-18 the disequalities were asserted
-- in a comment with no term behind them; an audit caught it.)

  -- CORRECTION, 2026-08-18, found by an audit.  This section previously

  -- group law is `s ∙₁ inv s ≡ unit D`, a path between `Sol` values.  UPDATE
  -- 2026-08-19: that path now EXISTS — ⊛InvR/⊛InvL in §7, assembled from the
  -- two COORDINATE equations below the same way the monoid axioms are.  The
  -- two obstructions this note named are both gone: R IS a set (it is a
  -- CommRing) and associativity is proved (§7 ⊛Assoc).  So the norm-1
  -- solutions ARE a group; the coordinate equations below are its inverse
  -- law's content.
  --
  -- What they say is worth having on its own.  `normNegB` (in `Bhavana`) says
  -- the form is even in b: N D a (−b) ≡ N D a b.  So negating b sends a
  -- solution to a solution of the same norm, and composing the two returns the

  -- 7.  The composition is commutative — and commutativity is NOT what
  -- makes a monoid.
  --
  -- CORRECTION, 2026-08-18, found by an audit of this lane.  This section
  -- previously read "the composition is commutative, which is what makes the
  -- solutions a MONOID rather than merely a set closed under an operation".
  -- That is false: a monoid needs ASSOCIATIVITY and a unit; commutativity is
  -- neither and gets a commutative monoid only once you already have one.
  -- The claim was inherited verbatim from `BhavanaSemiring.agda`'s §89–92 and
  -- repeated here with that file cited as authority — which is the exp27
  -- propagation pattern the protocol exists to prevent, reproduced inside the
  -- lane that quotes the protocol.
  --
  -- ASSOCIATIVITY OF `_⊛_` at the coordinate level is now PROVED (2026-08-19,
  -- ⊛AssocA/⊛AssocB below, from bhA-assoc/bhB-assoc in Bhavana.Form — abstract
  -- R, solver-free).  Together with commutativity (⊛CommA/⊛CommB) and the unit
  -- laws (⊛UnitA/⊛UnitB), ALL THREE monoid axioms now hold at the level of the
  -- two coordinates.  And the Sol-LEVEL associativity is now ALSO assembled
  -- (⊛Assoc below): a PathP between the two `Sol` records over the norm index
  -- `·Assoc k₁ k₂ k₃`, built from the two coordinate paths and a `hasNorm`
  -- PathP that isProp→PathP fills because R is a set (being a CommRing).  So
  -- `_⊛_` is associative as an operation on solutions, not merely on their
  -- coordinates — the blocker this note was written to guard is cleared.  And
  -- the Sol-level UNIT paths are now assembled too (⊛IdR/⊛IdL, over `·IdR`/
  -- `·IdL`), so EVERY monoid axiom holds as a path between `Sol` values: the
  -- solutions of a fixed norm form a monoid, and the graded family multiplies
  -- its norm indices.  No axiom is left as a coordinate-only statement.

-- ATTRIBUTION CORRECTED, 2026-08-18.  This read "Brahmagupta's own worked

-- it.  Brahmagupta's showcase examples in Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta ch. 18 are
-- D = 83 and D = 92.  The 3/2, 17/12, 99/70 ladder is the classical sequence
-- of √2 convergents and is far older than 628 — Baudhāyana's Śulba-sūtra
-- value 577/408 lies on it — so naming it Brahmagupta's took a result from an
-- older tradition and filed it under a later one, which is the exact error
-- CLAUDE.md's directive is about, committed inside the lane that quotes the
-- directive.  Treat the Śulba attribution as the sourcing I can defend and
-- the specific verse as still unchecked.
--
-- Every equation below is `refl` — the kernel computes the composite and its
-- norm, which makes this an exact verification and not a check somebody ran.
