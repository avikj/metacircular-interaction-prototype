-- FunctionBoundFromConstant
--
-- *** THIS FILE MUST FAIL TO TYPE-CHECK. ***
--
-- Designed annihilation (collab/PROTOCOL.md §7), companion to
-- `ConstantBoundNotFunctionBound` (exit 0 under the pin).
--
-- WHAT IT ASSERTS.  `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_6.md` §C1: the worker message
-- `collab/messages/workers/20260812T144712.509661Z--claude_aime_body--
-- 0003.md` concludes from two Mersenne witnesses that "Y≥1 is sharp,
-- **no function of (b,n) improves it**".  Asserted below is exactly
-- that sentence's universal over functions, together with the
-- constant-sharpness statement its two witnesses actually establish.
--
-- WHY IT MUST FAIL.  Two points bound the CONSTANT, not every FUNCTION.
-- At (2,11), Φ₁₁(2) = 2047 = 23·89, so the yield there is 2, and the
-- valid bound `Y` itself exceeds 1 there:
-- `ConstantBoundNotFunctionBound.dropped-scope-false` derives ⊥ from
-- precisely the type asserted here.
--
-- NO LEXICAL SIGNATURE.  The sentence is true up to one quantifier
-- promotion, and quantifier promotions have no spelling: "no function
-- of (b,n) improves it" and "the constant cannot be improved" share
-- every content word.  grep cannot see a scope; a type can.
--
-- It is NOT part of the checked build.  `agda` does not
-- import it, and nothing else may.
--
-- OBSERVED, 2026-08-15, THE PIN (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9; see
-- notes/TOOLCHAIN_SKEW_AND_COVERAGE.md §6.1), `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 agda
-- --library-file=<v0.9>
-- NaturalMachine/Control/FunctionBoundFromConstant.agda`, exit code 42,

--   error: [UnequalTerms]
--   2 != 1 of type ℕ
--   when checking that the expression refl has type
--   0 Cubical.Data.Nat.+ Y 2 11 ≡ 1
--
-- Read it: the machine prints the value the two-witness argument never
-- looked at.  `2 != 1` is Φ₁₁(2) = 2047 = 23·89 against the bound the
-- sentence claimed no function could beat.
--
-- If a future edit makes this file compile, a two-point computation has
-- again been promoted to a universal over functions and the corpus has
-- readmitted the defect FULL_READ_DRAW_6 §C1 catalogued.
