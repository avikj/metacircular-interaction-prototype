-- MaximizerWithoutNonvanishing
--
-- *** THIS FILE MUST FAIL TO TYPE-CHECK. ***
--
-- Designed annihilation (collab/PROTOCOL.md §7), in the pattern of
-- `Control/WrongEquivalence.agda`, `Control/WrongFirstStep.agda`,
-- `Control/QuantifierDrop.agda` and `Control/InflationFlattened.agda`.
--
-- §2 -- "every finite `E` **with `f != 0` on `E`** has a point that
-- fails to transport: any point maximizing `v_p(f)`" -- WITHOUT the
-- nonvanishing clause, which is how the summary message
-- `workers/20260812T090934.276887Z--claude_ananta--0005.md` §3 restates
-- it: "every finite `E` has a point that cannot transport -- any
--
-- WHY IT MUST FAIL.  The dropped clause is what makes "the maximizer"
-- denote.  On the model of `FiniteWorldMaximizer` the
-- degenerate world `f = 0` on `E` has no point at which the observable
-- fails to vanish, hence no maximizer at all
-- (`vanishing-world-has-no-maximizer`), and
-- `dropped-hypothesis-false` derives ⊥ from precisely the type asserted
-- below.
--
-- The two assertions are the two ways the drop happens in prose:
-- (a) state the conclusion for every world, discharging it with the
-- theorem that still wants the clause; (b) claim the clause is free --
-- that even the vanishing world satisfies it.
--
-- This is the instrument for a defect with NO LEXICAL SIGNATURE: the
-- shortened sentence contains no wrong word, only a missing clause, so
-- grep cannot see it and a type can.
--
-- It is NOT part of the checked build.  `agda` does not
-- import it, and nothing else may: the directory
-- `NaturalMachine/Control/` is excluded from the root aggregate exactly
-- so its contents may fail.
--
-- OBSERVED, 2026-08-15, container toolchain (Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5;
-- `formal/cubical/BUILD.md` pins 2.8.0 + v0.9, check OUTSTANDING),
-- `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 agda NaturalMachine/Control/MaximizerWithoutNonvanishing.agda`,
-- exit code 42, error verbatim:
--
--   /home/user/math/formal/cubical/NaturalMachine/Control/MaximizerWithoutNonvanishing.agda:84,23-34
--   NonVanishing W → Σ-syntax Pt (MaxAt W) !=< Σ Pt (MaxAt W)
--   when checking that the expression maximizer W has type
--   Σ-syntax Pt (MaxAt W)
--
-- Read it: what `maximizer W` still wants, and what the asserted type
-- does not supply, is `NonVanishing W` — the dropped clause "`f != 0`
-- on `E`", named by the machine, in the position where the summary
-- deleted it.
--
-- (Agda stops at the first error, so the second assertion,
-- `every-world-nonvanishing`, is not reached.  Checked separately by
-- commenting out the first (same file, two lines commented out, then
-- restored): it fails at 88,30-32 with
--   Cubical.Data.Unit.Unit !=< Cubical.Data.Empty.Base.⊥
--   when checking that the expression tt has type
--   FiniteWorldMaximizer.IsFin (vanishing-world q)
-- — the world where the observable vanishes identically cannot be given
-- the certificate, which is exactly the case the clause excludes.)
--
-- If a future edit makes this file compile, the finite no-go has been
-- silently extended past its nonvanishing hypothesis and the corpus has
-- readmitted exactly the defect `FULL_READ_DRAW_5` §C1 catalogued.
