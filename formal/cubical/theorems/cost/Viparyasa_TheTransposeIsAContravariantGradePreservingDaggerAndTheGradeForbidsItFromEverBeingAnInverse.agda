-- विपर्यास — transposition.  The kernel is a DAGGER, not a groupoid.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS.  The kernel's `reverse` is a constructor of Step, which
-- is the passage from functions to CORRESPONDENCES: a function has no
-- transpose, a correspondence does.  This file constructs the transpose
-- on whole derivations and proves the three laws that make it a dagger
-- structure on the strict category of derivations —
--
--   §2  daṇḍa : Derivation x y → Derivation y x, with daṇḍa (done) = done
--       and CONTRAVARIANT functoriality proved:
--       daṇḍa (d ⊕ e) ≡ daṇḍa e ⊕ daṇḍa d.
--   §3  daṇḍa PRESERVES THE GRADE: dairghya (daṇḍa d) ≡ dairghya d.
--       The transpose costs what the route cost; it forgets nothing.
--   §4  daṇḍa is NOT an involution on the nose — the double transpose of
--       a one-step derivation is refuted by counting its reversal marks —
--       and, the wall: NO function whatsoever is an inverse for ⊕.  Not
--       daṇḍa, not a cleverer candidate: the grade is additive and
--       detects the unit, so `d ⊕ f d ≡ done` dies at a length-one
--       derivation for every f.  This is the Laghava dichotomy (a
--       structure is graded or invertible, never both) landed on the
--       kernel's own category: what survives the prohibition of the
--       inverse is exactly the dagger.
--
-- THE MOTIVIC SENTENCE, stated as the reading it is.  Morphisms of
-- motives are correspondences closed under transpose; a category of
-- correspondences is self-dual and NOT a groupoid, and its linearisation
-- is what discards the route.  Here the same shape is a theorem: the
-- derivation category carries its transpose as structure (§2–§3) and is
-- forbidden its inverse by its own grading (§4) — dagger yes, groupoid
-- never, and the gap between the two is where every unit of cost in the
-- corpus lives (abstract 13).  The identification of `reverse` with the
-- transpose of a Chow correspondence is a reading and is not proved.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No cycles, no varieties, no linearisation and
-- no additive category appear.  `daṇḍa` is defined on the kernel of
-- README-draft-2 §3 as it stands in RewriteCertificate.agda, and every
-- law below is about that object.

-- The dagger itself survives the prohibition it is subject to: daṇḍa is

-- ५ · The semantic collapse.  The interpretation sends the dagger to
-- path inversion — up to a filler that exists because the meaning lives
-- in a set.  Syntactically the dagger is weak (§4); semantically its
-- whole weakness is quotiented in one stroke: every route and its
-- transpose interpret to inverse paths, with no case analysis, because
-- an identity type over ℕ is a proposition.  This is the master
-- abstract's "one order-two redundancy the interpretation divides out",
-- exhibited on the dagger itself.
