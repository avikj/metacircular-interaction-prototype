--
-- ON THE NAME.  **No tradition term is claimed and none is invented.**
-- Univalence, `ua` and transport are Voevodsky's and the cubical
-- library's — the substrate this repository is checked in, which
-- `CLAUDE.md` explicitly exempts from the framing rule ("tools are not
-- frames").  There is no Indian source for this statement and inventing
-- a Sanskrit label would assert a provenance nobody checked.  Checked
-- before naming: `.claude/hooks/priority-ledger.txt` (CURRENT header)
-- grepped first.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE AUDIT.  `TransportCost` says:
--
--   "two separate questions remain, and **both are decided by execution
--    rather than by proof** … (2) NO.  Native is flat in the number of
--    chained operations; the transported term is quadratic, **because
--    transport across `ua e` *is* `e⁻¹ ∘ f ∘ (e × e)`** — a full round
--    trip through ℕ per operation, and `valueC`/`digitsC` are unary."
--
-- **The sentence after "because" is not an explanation of a
-- measurement.  It is `Cubical.Foundations.Univalence.transportUAop₂`,
-- a library lemma, verbatim:**
--
--   transportUAop₂ : (e : A ≃ B) (f : A → A → A) (x y : B)
--     → transport (λ i → ua e i → ua e i → ua e i) f x y
--       ≡ equivFun e (f (invEq e x) (invEq e y))
--
-- So the mechanism was never measured; it was already proved, upstream,
-- and the module cites it while calling the result execution-decided.
-- `CLAUDE.md`'s rule applies exactly: *"No claim of the form 'measured
-- slope ≈ x' survives if the slope is derivable."*  §2 below derives the
-- structure the slope comes from.
--
-- **AND THE BUILD STATUS MATTERS, so it is stated with its command.**
-- On the CONTAINER, `TransportCost.agda` does not typecheck at all:
--
--   cd formal/cubical && agda -i . NaturalMachine/TransportCost.agda
--   → TRANSPORTCOST_EXIT=42
--
-- because it opens `NaturalMachine`, hence `Transport`,
-- whose first error is `Transport.agda:46,50-65` — the same upstream
-- `solveℕ!` import that fails the two aggregate gates.  So **its
-- `refl`s cannot be re-verified here**, and its answer to question (1)
-- ("YES.  Every `refl` below forces evaluation and typechecks") is not
-- currently checkable on this toolchain.  That is a fact about the
-- container, NOT a doubt about the claim, and NOT that module's fault.
-- **This module therefore depends on none of it** — nothing below
-- imports `NaturalMachine`, and everything below is checked.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED, for an ARBITRARY equivalence and binary operation
--
--   T                   the transported operation
--   step                = `transportUAop₂`, named here so the mechanism
--                         is a hypothesis-free theorem in this file too
--   iterN / iterT       `n` chained operations, native and transported,
--                         against a fixed right argument
--   theRoundTripsAreRedundant
--                       `iterT n (e .fst a) ≡ e .fst (iterN n a)`
--
-- **THAT LAST IS THE DERIVATION THE MEASUREMENT WAS STANDING IN FOR.**
-- Each transported step provably inserts `invEq e ∘ e .fst` around an
-- argument that was already in `A`'s image.  On VALUES that composite is
-- the identity — which is why the theorem holds and why the two agree.
-- On TERMS it is not removed, because nothing removes it: `retEq` is a
-- path, and a path is not a reduction.  So `n` chained operations carry
-- exactly `n` provably-redundant round trips, one per step, and the
-- quadratic in the audited note is that `n` multiplied by the cost of
-- one round trip in a UNARY representation.  Nothing was measured to
-- get here.
--
-- SYĀT — THE CLAIM, EXACTLY.  **`TransportCost` is NOT amended and NOT
-- retracted**; its answers are, as far as I can tell, correct, and §1
-- above is about how one of them was justified, not whether it holds.
-- **No cost model is formalised and none exists in Agda here**: the
-- count of round trips is a theorem, the arithmetic "n round trips ×
-- linear each = quadratic" is ordinary arithmetic done in this header
-- and NOT checked below, and I do not claim a machine-checked
-- complexity result.  Nothing is claimed about `CanWord`, `valueC`,
-- `digitsC`, `_⊕_`, or `transport-+-is-⊕` — none is imported.  The
-- converse — that removing the round trips would make the transported
-- term flat — is not proved; that is a statement about an
-- implementation that does not exist.
--
-- CHECKED on the CONTAINER (Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — NOT the declared
-- pin, Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9).  --safe, no postulates, no holes.
