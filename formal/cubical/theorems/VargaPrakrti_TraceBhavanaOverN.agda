-- VargaPrakrti_TraceBhavanaOverN — भावना और चक्रवाल with the middle
-- coefficient carried, over ℕ, subtraction-free.
--
-- वर्ग-प्रकृति ("square-nature") is BRAHMAGUPTA's own name, in the
-- Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628), ch. 18, for the object of his composition
-- rule.  WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF HIM: he composes
-- x² − D y² with arbitrary kṣepa, which is T = 0 below.  The parameter T
-- is NOT his and is not attributed to him; it is what the composition
-- becomes in ℤ[ω] with ω² = T·ω + C, and it is introduced here because
-- restricting the reactor to T = 0 was restricting Brahmagupta's rule to
-- the one equation that later displaced it.  The identities below at
-- T = 0 ARE his, and that specialisation is exhibited at the bottom of
-- this file as a checked term rather than asserted.
--
-- THE FORM.   N(x, y) = x² + T·x·y − C·y²,  Δ = T² + 4C.
--
--   T = 0, C = D  is  x² − D y²  — Brahmagupta's, and `Nalanda.hs`'s.
--   T = 1, C = (Δ−1)/4  is the principal form of a discriminant
--                Δ ≡ 1 (mod 4), i.e. the norm form of the MAXIMAL order
--                ℤ[(1+√Δ)/2], which contains ℤ[√Δ] with index 2 and which
--                x² − D y² = 1 cannot see.
--
-- WHY ℕ AND WHY SUBTRACTION-FREE.  Twice-learned in this lane and
-- unchanged here.  `BhavanaSemiring.agda`: bhāvanā as classically written
-- is FALSE over ℕ because monus truncates, and moving every negative term
-- across makes it true with no hypothesis and makes it a commutative-
-- SEMIRING identity — no induction, no ordering, no case split on a sign.
-- `CakravalaNat.agda`: the same move applied to the cycle, which is what
-- removed the sign of k as an obstacle rather than handling it.  And the
-- hard constraint underneath both: cubical's ℤ multiplication is unary
-- (`pos (suc n) · m = m + pos n · m`), so a `refl` on the nine- and
-- fifteen-digit integers these runs produce asks the kernel for ~10¹⁸
-- unfoldings and never returns, while cubical's ℕ is `Agda.Builtin.Nat`
-- with GMP-backed `_+_` and `_·_` and is instant.
--
-- HOW THE SUBTRACTION IS CLEARED, so the statements can be read.  Write
-- Qᵢ = xᵢ² + T·xᵢyᵢ, so that N(xᵢ, yᵢ) = Qᵢ − C·yᵢ².  Then over ℤ
--
--     N(X, Y) = N(x₁,y₁)·N(x₂,y₂)
--
-- expands to  (X² + T·XY) − C·Y² = (Q₁ − Cy₁²)(Q₂ − Cy₂²), and carrying
-- every negative term across gives the statement below, in which nothing
-- is subtracted anywhere.  Over ℤ it IS bhāvanā, by adding the same two
-- terms to both sides.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.  --safe, no postulates, no holes.
--
--   bhavanaTraceℕ     the composition law with the middle coefficient,
--                     for ALL naturals T C x₁ y₁ x₂ y₂.
--   cakravalaTraceℕ   the cycle's step — composition with the
--                     interpolator (m, 1) — for ALL naturals T C a b m.
--   vpXIsBrahmagupta / vpYIsBrahmagupta
--                     at T = 0 the two composed coordinates ARE
--                     `BhavanaSemiring.cx` and `.cy`, checked, so the
--                     generalisation demonstrably contains the source's
--                     own statement rather than replacing it.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT PROVED HERE, stated so no reader infers it.  Termination of
-- the cycle (Lagrange 1768 for T = 0; open in this repository).
-- Minimality of Bhāskara's choice rule.  The bookkeeping — k and k′
-- themselves — which is where the signs live; these are the step's
-- IDENTITY, not its accounts.

-- BRAHMAGUPTA'S TWO COORDINATES, TRANSCRIBED RATHER THAN IMPORTED, and
-- the reason is a defect in the lane that must not be papered over.
--
-- `BhavanaSemiring.agda` defines exactly `cx` and `cy` below and this file
-- would import them.  It cannot: `BhavanaSemiring.agda`, `CakravalaNat
-- .agda` and `Brahmagupta.agda` DO NOT CHECK under the toolchain
-- `BUILD.md` pins (Agda 2.8.0, cubical v0.9).  They call
-- `Cubical.Tactics.NatSolver.Reflection.solve`, the point-free solver of
-- cubical v0.5, which v0.9 replaced with the hole macro `solveℕ!`.  The
-- error is `[NotInScope] solve`, reproducible in one command:
--
--     cd formal/cubical && agda BhavanaSemiring.agda
--
-- The consequence reaches further than this file: `machine/NalandaEmit.hs`
-- emits a witness importing `BhavanaSemiring` and `CakravalaNat`, and
-- `machine/NalandaCertify.hs` hands that witness to the kernel and reports
-- the verdict.  Under the pinned toolchain that pipeline cannot return a
-- green, because its dependencies do not check.  BUILD.md §"Where the skew
-- bites" catalogues the 2.6.3 → 2.8.0 migration and says the tree "is not
-- claimed to be dual-version compatible"; these three modules are on the
-- wrong side of it.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, and why.  The repair is mechanical — the import
-- line and one token per theorem — and it is NOT done in this commit,
-- because those are another identity's modules and a silent rewrite of
-- someone else's file is the move CLAUDE.md forbids for renames and which
-- has the same shape here.  The defect is written instead, with the
-- command that reproduces it and the exact substitution that closes it, so
-- it is an offer and not an edit.
--
-- What this file does instead is stand alone: the two coordinates below
-- are transcribed verbatim from `BhavanaSemiring.agda` so that the
-- containment claim — that the generalisation at T = 0 IS Brahmagupta's
-- statement — is a checked term here and does not wait on that repair.

-- THE CONTAINMENT, AS A CHECKED TERM.
--
-- The statement below is `BhavanaSemiring.bhavanaℕ` verbatim — Brahmagupta's
-- composition law over ℕ as this repository already states it.  It is NOT
-- proved here by calling the solver again, which would show only that both
-- are semiring identities and would leave the generalisation and the source
-- as two unrelated true things.  It is `transport`ed out of
-- `bhavanaTraceℕ 0 D x₁ y₁ x₂ y₂` along the two coordinate equalities
-- above.  So: the general law AT T = 0 IS his law, and the kernel says so.
--
-- The `0 · (X · Y) +` summand of the general statement disappears
-- definitionally at T = 0, because ℕ's builtin `_·_` reduces `zero · m` to
-- `zero` and `_+_` reduces `zero + w` to `w`.  Only `vpQ 0 x y = x · x + 0`
-- and `vpY 0 = cy` need the transport, since `_+_` recurses on its FIRST
-- argument and `x + 0` is therefore not definitionally `x`.
