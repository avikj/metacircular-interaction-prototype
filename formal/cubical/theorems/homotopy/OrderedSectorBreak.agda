-- OrderedSectorBreak
--
-- DELTA 14, PROGRAM 14.72: the positive-cone subtype, and the exact
-- nonrestriction statement, as an inhabitant of
-- `PerspectiveCore.SectorBreak`.
--
-- Delta 14 C14.7 is the target sentence:
--
--   "Ambient equivalence can fail after sector selection precisely
--    because the sector predicate is not invariant."
--
-- `CenterRelative` supplies the ambient equivalence
-- Φ : Pair ≃ Centre over any CommRing in which 2 is invertible, and says
-- in its own "WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED" that the positive cone cannot even be
-- posed there because `R` carries no order.  This file poses it.  Neither
-- `CenterRelative.agda` nor `PerspectiveCore.agda` is edited; both are
-- imported.
--
--
-- THE ORDER: A PARAMETER, NOT AN INSTANCE.  WHY.
--
-- The brief allowed either adding an order as a further parameter or
-- instantiating at a concrete ordered ring.  **Parameter**, for a reason
-- that is a fact about the pinned toolchain and not a preference:
--
--   cubical v0.5 contains no ordered commutative ring in which 2 is
--   invertible.  `Cubical.Data.Int` has no order module; `Cubical.HITs.
--   Rationals.QuoQ` builds ℚ as a set quotient but gives it **no
--   `CommRing` instance and no order**; `Cubical.Algebra` has
--   `OrderedCommMonoid` and nothing ordered above it.  Instantiating
--   would therefore mean first constructing ℤ[1/2] or ℚ as a `CommRing`
--   **and** its order — a module's worth of work orthogonal to C14.7,
--   which is a statement about a *predicate*, not about any particular
--   ring.
--
-- Two consequences are taken seriously rather than hidden.
--
--  (1) The hypotheses are kept as small as the theorem needs, so that a
--      reader can check satisfiability by inspection instead of trusting
--      a bundle.  §2's break needs **exactly two**: a positivity
--      predicate `P` with `P 1r` inhabited and `P 0r` uninhabited.  Any
--      ordered field supplies them.  §4's break needs four more, and they
--      are the axioms of a strictly ordered abelian group with `0 < 1`
--      — no multiplicative compatibility, no trichotomy, no decidability.
--      In particular **`0 < half` is never assumed**, which is why the
--      witnesses below are chosen as they are.
--
--  (2) NOT CLAIMED, and this is the honest gap: **no model of the
--      hypotheses is constructed here.**  The theorems are conditional on
--      the bundle being inhabited.  That ℚ with its usual order inhabits
--      it is standard and is CITED, not formalized.  What *is* checked is
--      that the bundle has bite: `StrictOrder.nontrivial` derives
--      `¬ (1r ≡ 0r)` from it, so it is not satisfied by the trivial ring
--      and is not vacuous dressing on the break.
--
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED, BY DELTA-14 NUMBER
--
--   §1  `PairCone`           the positive-cone subtype `p > 0 ∧ q > 0`,
--       `PositiveCone`       and its total space, on the Pair side.
--       `CentreCone`         the SAME predicate named in the Centre
--                            chart, `w > 0 ∧ r > 0`.
--       `Sector`             the natural Centre sector `w > 0`.
--       `Transported`        the sector the cone actually becomes,
--                            `w − r > 0 ∧ w + r > 0`, i.e. `|r| < w`.
--
--   §2  `break-diagonal`     C14.7: an inhabitant of `SectorBreak` for
--                            (Φ, PairCone, CentreCone).  Witness: the
--                            DIAGONAL pair `(1,1)`, strictly inside the
--                            positive cone, whose centre image sits on
--                            the wall `r = 0`.
--       `no-fibrewise-…`     hence, by `sector-not-inv`, no fibrewise
--                            correspondence of the two predicates exists.
--
--   §3  `cone-restricts`     T14.6 sufficient direction, POSITIVELY: Φ
--                            *does* restrict, to `Transported`.  This is
--                            the Feynman half — the transported sector is
--                            derived (it is `PairCone ∘ Ψ`, on the nose),
--                            not guessed, and it is `|r| < w`.
--
--   §4  `sector-break`       C14.7 again, in the direction that matters
--                            for the "natural" sector: `w > 0` does NOT
--                            restrict to the positive cone along Ψ.
--                            Witness `(w,r) = (1,2)`: centre positive,
--                            pair `(−1,3)` not.
--
--   §5  `ambient`            the ambient equivalence, unrestricted, still
--                            there — so the failure is produced by sector
--                            selection and by nothing else.  That
--                            juxtaposition IS C14.7.
--
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * **No claim that `Sector` is a bad choice of sector.**  §3 shows the
--    cone transports to `|r| < w`; §4 shows `w > 0` is strictly weaker in
--    the sense that its Ψ-image leaves the cone.  Neither says `w > 0` is
--    uninteresting; it says it is not *the transport of* the cone.
--
--  * **No converse.**  `SectorBreak` refutes fibrewise correspondence
--    (that is `sector-not-inv`).  It does not refute the existence of
--    SOME equivalence `Σ Pair PairCone ≃ Σ Centre Sector` — such a thing
--    may exist and permute the base.  `PerspectiveCore` says exactly this
--    about T14.6's "iff", and nothing here strengthens it.
--
--  * **No archimedean or completeness content.**  `<-+ˡ` is translation
--    invariance only.  The order is not assumed total, decidable, or
--    compatible with multiplication.
