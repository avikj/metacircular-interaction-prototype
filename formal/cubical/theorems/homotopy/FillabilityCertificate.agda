-- FillabilityCertificate
--
-- the CERTIFICATE STRUCTURE of the two fillability predicates of that
-- note's Def 2.2.2, formalised as datatypes and decision procedures.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT FORMALISED HERE.  The note's §3 classifies
-- Fill_term as Σ⁰₁ and Fill_∞ as Π⁰₂ (finite branching) / Σ¹₁ (without)
-- relative to its Effectivity Hypothesis (E).  The arithmetical
-- hierarchy itself is NOT formalised: there is no model of computation
-- here, no oracle, and nothing is postulated.  What is in reach of
-- --safe cubical Agda, and is all that is claimed below, is the
-- certificate structure that those classifications are about — a finite
-- certificate as an inductive type, a coinductive branch, the strict
-- separation of the two, and decision procedures that visibly CONSUME
-- the hypotheses (finite branching, truncation) the note says they need.
--
-- HEADLINE STATEMENTS (all checked, no postulates, no holes, --safe):
--
--  1. Cert / FillTerm      The finite certificate of the note's
--                          Fill_term (Def 2.2.2, §3.4(i)): an inductive
--                          list of chosen fillers ending in a
--                          distinguished obstruction.  `FillTerm` is
--                          "there exists a certificate".  Being
--                          inductive, it is finite by construction —
--                          this is the honest content of "Σ⁰₁ with a
--                          finite certificate": positive instances are
--                          exhibited and checked, in finite time, by
--                          the kernel.
--
--  2. Branch / FillInf     The note's Fill_∞: a coinductive total
--                          choice function filling every level.
--     cert→branch          Prop 2.2.3 (⇒), which needs — and here
--                          explicitly takes — the hypothesis that a
--                          distinguished obstruction has an identity
--                          filler whose boundary is again distinguished.
--
--  3. A∞ / noCert / branchA∞
--                          Prop 2.2.3 STRICTNESS, as the note's own A_∞
--                          witness: a system in which every level is
--                          filled (a branch exists) and no level is ever
--                          distinguished (no certificate exists).
--                          FillInf ∧ ¬ FillTerm, both proved.
--                          This system is FINITELY (indeed uniquely)
--                          branching, so it is simultaneously the
--                          formal shadow of §4.2's refutation of
--                          nilpotence: the hypothesis that bounds the
--                          BRANCHING does not bound the LENGTH.  See 6.
--
--  4. decBCert             The decision procedure, as a term: for each
--                          fuel k, `Dec` of "there is a certificate of
--                          depth ≤ k".  It takes decidability of the
--                          distinguished-element check and a FINITE
--                          BRANCHING structure (`FinBranch`: a finite
--                          enumeration of the fillers at each node, with
--                          a covering proof) as explicit arguments.
--                          Delete either argument and the term does not
--                          typecheck — the consumption is the point.
--
--  5. truncCert            Theorem 4.1: an N-truncated system (every
--     truncated-FillTerm   obstruction at level ≥ N is distinguished)
--                          admits a certificate of depth ≤ N, hence
--                          Fill_term holds and is DECIDABLE — trivially,
--                          by `yes`.  This is also the note's COST
--                          bound: the tower is bounded exactly by the
--                          truncation of the ambient, and the depth
--                          index of the constructed BCert IS that bound.
--
--  6. infBranch-decides-∃  The asymmetry, in the only form that is a
--                          theorem rather than an observation about
--                          which arguments a term mentions: for a system
--                          with INFINITE branching at level 0, a
--                          decision procedure for `Cert` would decide
--                          `Σ[ k ∈ ℕ ] P k ≡ true` for an arbitrary
--                          P : ℕ → Bool.  So certificate-existence is
--                          not decidable without finite branching, on
--                          pain of deciding an arbitrary unbounded
--                          existential; positive instances stay
--                          exhibitable (`∃→Cert`), negative ones do not.
--                          That is the checkable shadow of §3.4's
--                          "failure cannot be reported".
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT CLAIMED.
--  * No Σ⁰₁/Π⁰₂/Σ¹₁ statement.  6 is a reduction to an unbounded
--    existential over ℕ, not a recursion-theoretic non-decidability
--    theorem: constructively `Σ[ k ∈ ℕ ] P k ≡ true` is simply not
--    known decidable, and that — not undecidability — is what is used.
--  * No ordinals, no homotopy colimits, no 2-cells.  The tower here is
--    ℕ-indexed; the note's §0(iii) and §2.4 already record that no
--    formalism in this corpus carries the ordinal display, and Thm
--    3.2(d) (the ordinal case, Σ¹₁) is therefore out of reach and is
--    not formalised.  Levels are ℕ, limits do not occur.
--  * `Obs`, `Filler`, `∂` are abstract: nothing here says the note's
--    ambients admit such a presentation.  This is the SHAPE the note's
--    §2.2 fixes, checked for internal consistency and separation.
--  * The note's §5 (Theorem 5.3: the dividing line for quantitative
--    defects is ARITY, not an attainable zero) is NOT formalised here.
--    It is formalised in `ArityOfRepair`, which imports
--    this module's A∞ for the "escapes Theorem A" half.
--  * §4.2's refutation of nilpotence is formalised in its ABSTRACT
--    form only (3 above: finite branching does not bound length).  The
--    note gives no space-level counterexample beyond the citation that
--    spheres are nilpotent with non-terminating Postnikov towers, and
--    that is not formalisable here.
