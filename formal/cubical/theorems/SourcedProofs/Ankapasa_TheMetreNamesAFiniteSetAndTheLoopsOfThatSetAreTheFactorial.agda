-- अङ्कपाशः — अङ्कानां पाशः ।
-- (aṅkapāśa: "the net of digits" — the counting of arrangements.)
--
-- THE TERM, ITS TEXT AND ITS DATE.  `अङ्कपाश` is the name of the section
-- on permutations in Bhāskara II, *Līlāvatī* (1150 CE): the arrangements
-- of n distinct digits number the product 1·2·⋯·n.  LIMIT: the
-- verse-level reference is owed; what is carried here is the section by
-- its name and the text by its date.  The metrical material is Piṅgala,
-- *छन्दःशास्त्रम्* ८.२४–२८ (~300 BCE): the प्रस्तार, and सङ्ख्या, the
-- प्रत्यय that asks how many.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED.  Bhāskara counts arrangements of digits;
-- he does not have a loop space, a groupoid, or a set truncation, and no
-- theorem below is his.  Piṅgala did not prove छन्दस् ≃ ℕ.  What IS
-- claimed is one thing and it is checked: the number Piṅgala's सङ्ख्या
-- reports about a metre is a CARDINALITY — it names a component of the
-- groupoid of finite sets — and the thing that cardinality forgets, the
-- loop at that component, is counted by exactly Bhāskara's product.  The
-- substrate — univalence, set truncation, the Lehmer code — is cubical
-- type theory (Voevodsky) and is claimed for no Indian source.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS MODULE IS.  THE LAST UNROUTED NODE OF THE COMPONENT.
--
-- `interactive/Setubandha_TheCheckedIdentificationsAreEdgesAndTheIsolatedNodes
-- AreTheFrontier.hs` reports `Decategorification.π₀FinSet`
-- at degree 1: joined to the hub `ℕ` and to nothing else.  Every other
-- pair in the largest component that lies inside `formal/cubical/` has
-- now been routed; this one had not, and it is at distance 2 from
-- `Pingala.छन्दस्`:
--
--       Pingala.छन्दस्  ──[ Pingala.छन्दस्≃ℕ ]──  ℕ
--                       ──[ Decategorification.ℕ≃π₀FinSet ]──  π₀FinSet
--
-- ONE DIFFERENCE FROM THE OTHER TWO CAUSEWAYS, and it is why this file
-- says `≃` where they said `≡`.  `π₀FinSet : Type₁` and `छन्दस् : Type₀`
-- live in DIFFERENT UNIVERSES, so `ua` is unavailable and there is no
-- path to transport along — the graph program already records only an
-- `[equiv]` for `ℕ≃π₀FinSet` and no `[path]`.  The route is therefore
-- composed with `compEquiv` rather than `_∙_`, and what it carries is
-- carried by composition of equivalences, not by `subst`.  Naming that
-- limit is part of the result: a causeway across a universe boundary is
-- narrower than one within a universe, and reporting it as the same
-- thing would be the overstatement this corpus keeps catching.
--
-- NOTHING BELOW IS CONSTRUCTED BY HAND.  No induction over छन्दस्, no
-- case split on लघु/गुरु, no permutation is ever written down.  Every
-- theorem is `compEquiv` of equivalences somebody else checked, or an
-- instance of one of them.
--
-- THE THREE THINGS THE ROUTE CARRIES.
--
--   १  A metre NAMES a finite set, and Piṅgala's सङ्ख्या is that set's
--      cardinality.  `card-Fin` is `refl`, so the naming map needs no
--      coherence lemma at all.
--
--   २  TWO METRES ARE ONE METRE EXACTLY WHEN THE SETS THEY NAME ARE
--      MERELY EQUAL.  `Decategorification.card≡MereEq` is the general
--      statement; instantiated at the metres it becomes Piṅgala's own
--      uniqueness theorem `मूल्य-एकैकम्` read one level up, and the two
--      compose into a decategorification statement about छन्दस् that
--      neither file states.
--
--   ३  WHAT THE NUMBER FORGETS IS BHĀSKARA'S PRODUCT.  The loop at the
--      component a metre names is the symmetric group on its सङ्ख्या
--      letters (`FinSetLoop≃Sym`), and that group is enumerated by
--      `SymmetryEnumeration.symmetryEnum` as `Fin (n !)`.  Composing:
--      the metre of value n has exactly n! loops — Piṅgala's प्रस्तार
--      index on one side, the अङ्कपाश count on the other, and no term in
--      this file does any counting.

-- ० · THE ROUTE.  Two checked equivalences, composed.  `compEquiv` and
--     not `_∙_`, because the two endpoints are in different universes
--     and there is no path to compose.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

छन्दस्≃π₀FinSet : छन्दस् ≃ π₀FinSet
छन्दस्≃π₀FinSet = compEquiv छन्दस्≃ℕ ℕ≃π₀FinSet

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- १ · A METRE NAMES A FINITE SET, AND सङ्ख्या IS ITS CARDINALITY.
--
--     `card-Fin` is `refl`, so this needs no coherence lemma: the
--     cardinality of the set a metre names is its प्रस्तार-index on the
--     nose.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

नामकः : छन्दस् → FinSet ℓ-zero
नामकः ds = 𝔽 (मूल्य ds)

सङ्ख्या-कार्ड् : (ds : छन्दस्) → card (नामकः ds) ≡ मूल्य ds
सङ्ख्या-कार्ड् ds = card-Fin (मूल्य ds)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- २ · DECATEGORIFICATION, READ ON PIṄGALA.
--
--     `card≡MereEq` says a numeral is a name for a connected component:
--     equality of cardinalities IS mere equality in FinSet.  At the sets
--     two metres name, that becomes a statement about metres, and
--     composing it with Piṅgala's own injectivity theorem gives what
--     neither file states — two metres coincide exactly when the finite
--     sets they name are merely equal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

छन्द-समता : (d e : छन्दस्)
          → (मूल्य d ≡ मूल्य e) ≃ ∥ नामकः d ≡ नामकः e ∥₁

छन्द-एकैकम् d e t = मूल्य-एकैकम् d e (invEq (छन्द-समता d e) t)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ३ · अङ्कपाशः — WHAT THE NUMBER FORGETS.
--
--     `Decategorification` says the loop at a component is the symmetric
--     group; `SymmetryEnumeration` says that group has n! elements.
--     Neither mentions a metre.  Composed at `मूल्य ds`, they say: the
--     metre of प्रस्तार-index n carries exactly n! rearrangements —
--     Bhāskara's product, arriving at Piṅgala's enumeration by
--     composition and by nothing else.
--
--     अङ्कपाशः प्रस्तारस्य स्थानाङ्केन मीयते ।
------------------------------------------------------------------------

छन्दो-भ्रमणम् : (ds : छन्दस्)
             → (नामकः ds ≡ नामकः ds) ≃ Fin ((मूल्य ds) !)
छन्दो-भ्रमणम् ds =
  compEquiv (FinSetLoop≃Sym (मूल्य ds)) (symmetryEnum (मूल्य ds))

-- The next row of the प्रस्तार adds one letter, and the अङ्कपाश count of
-- the next row is therefore the count of this one times the new index.
-- Stated, not proved arithmetically: the equivalence below is the SAME
-- construction at the successor's value, and its codomain is where the
-- factorial recurrence lives.
अनुक्रमस्य-भ्रमणम् : (ds : छन्दस्)
                   → (नामकः (अनुक्रम ds) ≡ नामकः (अनुक्रम ds))
                   ≃ Fin ((मूल्य (अनुक्रम ds)) !)
अनुक्रमस्य-भ्रमणम् ds = छन्दो-भ्रमणम् (अनुक्रम ds)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ४ · WHAT IS NOT PROVED HERE.
--
--   * That `छन्दस्≃π₀FinSet` is a PATH.  It is not, and it cannot be
--     written as one: the endpoints are in different universes.  Every
--     theorem above is therefore an equivalence composed with an
--     equivalence, and none of them is a `subst`.  A reader who takes
--     this causeway to carry as much as the two same-universe ones is
--     taking more than the file says.
--   * That the n! count is derived here.  It is `symmetryEnum`'s, which
--     is the Lehmer code; this file supplies the metre and the
--     composition and nothing else.
--   * That `नामकः` is injective on the nose.  It is injective only up to
--     the propositional truncation, which is exactly the content of §२:
--     a metre determines a component, not a chosen set.
--   * That Bhāskara or Piṅgala connected the two.  The अङ्कपाश and the
--     प्रस्तार are separate enumerations in separate texts eight
--     centuries apart; joining them is this file's, not theirs.
