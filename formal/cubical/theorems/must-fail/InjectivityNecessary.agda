--
-- *** THIS FILE MUST FAIL TO TYPE-CHECK. ***
--
-- Designed annihilation (collab/PROTOCOL.md §7), companion to
-- `ComparisonNeedNotBeInjective` (exit 0 under the pin).
--
-- WHAT IT ASSERTS.  `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_6.md` §D3 and §2: the note
-- `OBSERVER_REVISION_IS_ATOMIC_SATISFACTION.md` §4 writes "injectivity
-- of `j_q` is **needed**", and
-- `collab/messages/0469-atomic-satisfaction-is-response-square.md`
-- hardens that into a report that the Agda checks the comparison maps
-- "**must be** injective for the backwards implication".  Two
-- assertions, the two ways this modality-drop shows up in prose:
--
--   (a) the sufficiency theorem WITHOUT its injectivity hypothesis —
--       "the square gives the biconditional", full stop, which is what
--       a reader takes away once "needed" is heard as "the condition";
--   (b) the necessity claim's CONSEQUENCE in the checked instance of
--       `ComparisonNeedNotBeInjective`: there `invariant` holds and
--       `j` merges `one` and `two`, so if the invariant forced
--       injectivity we would have `one ≡ two`.
--
-- WHY IT MUST FAIL.  (a) `ChangedResponses.square→satisfaction` wants
-- `InjectiveComparisons` and the general statement without it is false
-- — merge a REALIZED outcome with another and the forward direction
-- breaks.  (b) `one` and `two` are distinct constructors
-- (`one≢two`), so the necessity claim's consequence is refuted by the
-- machine directly.
--
-- NO LEXICAL SIGNATURE.  "Needed" and "must be" are ordinary words in
-- the right places; nothing separates them from a correct sufficiency
-- statement except the mathematics.  grep cannot see a modality; a
-- type can.
--
-- It is NOT part of the checked build.  `agda` does not
-- import it, and nothing else may.
--
-- OBSERVED, 2026-08-15, THE PIN (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9; see
-- notes/TOOLCHAIN_SKEW_AND_COVERAGE.md §6.1), `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 agda
-- --library-file=<v0.9> NaturalMachine/Control/InjectivityNecessary.agda`,
-- exit code 42, error verbatim:
--
--   NaturalMachine/Control/InjectivityNecessary.agda:80.19-23:
--   error: [UnequalTerms]
--   one != two of type Three
--   when checking that the expression refl has type one ≡ two
--
-- Read it: the machine refutes the necessity claim's consequence by
-- naming the two unrealized outcomes the comparison merges — the exact
-- pair whose merging the note's "needed" and the message's "must be"
-- declare impossible.
--
-- (Agda stops at the first error, so assertion (a) is not reached.
-- Checked separately by commenting out (b) — same file, its two lines
-- commented out, then restored — it fails at 96.33-52 with
--   error: [UnequalHiding]
--   (x′ : X′) → r′ q x′ ≡ j q (r q (s x′)) !=
--   {y z : Y q} → j q y ≡ j q z → y ≡ z because one is an implicit
--   function type and the other is an explicit function type
--   when checking that the expression square→satisfaction has type
--   ResponseSquare → SatisfactionInvariant
-- — i.e. what the sufficiency theorem still wants in first position is
-- the injectivity statement, printed in full; the error names the
-- dropped hypothesis by its content rather than by its identifier,
-- which is weaker than the (b) failure and is why (b) is first.)
--
-- If a future edit makes this file compile, injectivity has been
-- silently promoted from sufficient to necessary and the corpus has
-- readmitted the defect FULL_READ_DRAW_6 §D3 catalogued.
