-- Baddha — what the calculus binds and cannot release.
--
-- TERM.  बद्ध, bound / held fast.  Used here in its plain sense, and the
-- compound is chosen here: no text is cited for it and nothing below is
-- anyone's theorem.  (The corpus uses बद्धम् for the karma-count in
-- `Karma_…`; that is a different object and no connection is claimed.)
--
-- THIS MODULE REFUTES A CONJECTURE THIS AUTHOR STATED IN TWO OTHER
-- MODULES, EARLIER THE SAME DAY.  `Anupurvi_….NormalisationConjecture` and
-- `Samkhyana_….CompleteInvariantConjecture` both propose that the word of
-- variable occurrences together with the count of successors is a COMPLETE
-- invariant for derivability — that two terms agreeing on both are joined
-- by some derivation.  They are not.  There is a third conservation law,
-- it is independent of the other two, and it separates a pair on which
-- they agree.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS, before the proof, because the reason is the design fact.
-- The calculus has NO ASSOCIATIVITY.  Read the rules: `add-zero` deletes an
-- `add` whose right child is `zero`; `add-suc` lifts a successor out of a
-- right child to the front; the three congruences descend; `reverse`
-- undoes.  Nothing re-brackets.  So a successor sitting in the LEFT operand
-- of an `add` can never reach the front — unless that `add` is itself
-- deleted, and `add-zero` deletes it only when its right child is `zero`.
-- A right child that carries a variable can never become `zero`, because
-- `Anupurvi_…` proves the word is conserved.  Hence:
--
--     A SUCCESSOR IN A LEFT OPERAND WHOSE SIBLING CARRIES A VARIABLE IS
--     PERMANENTLY TRAPPED.
--
-- §1 counts exactly those, §2 proves the count is conserved by every rule,
-- and §3 exhibits the pair.
--
-- THE ENTANGLEMENT, which is the part worth reading twice.  The proof that
-- `trapped` is conserved CANNOT be done alone.  The congruence on the left
-- needs `constPart` to be conserved (a successor moved inside the left
-- operand must not change how many are trapped), and the congruence on the
-- right needs the WORD to be conserved (the sibling must not stop carrying
-- a variable).  So the third law is provable only in the presence of the
-- first two, and the three stand or fall together — which is why the
-- earlier conjecture was reasonable and why it is nonetheless false.
--
-- WHAT THE REFUTATION LEAVES STANDING.  Everything in the other modules.
-- The word is conserved; the constant is conserved; the meaning is their
-- function; soundness follows.  What falls is only the CONVERSE — that the
-- two suffice — and it fell to a third invariant rather than to an error.
-- The corrected statement, with no conjecture attached to it: derivability
-- implies agreement on word, constant AND trapped count, and whether those
-- three suffice is open and is now a sharper question than the one asked
-- this morning.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  Not that `trapped` completes the invariant;
-- §4 restates the open question and does not answer it.  Not that the
-- three laws are independent as a set — only that `trapped` is not a
-- function of the other two, which §3 establishes by exhibiting a pair
-- agreeing on both and differing on it.  Nothing here concerns `Step⁺`;
-- an associativity or commutativity rule would break §2 by design.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
