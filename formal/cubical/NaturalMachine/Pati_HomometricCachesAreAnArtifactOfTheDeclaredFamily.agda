-- पाटी (pāṭī) — the working board.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- SOURCE, AND WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED OF IT
--
--   Śrīdhara, *Pāṭīgaṇita* — also *Bṛhat-Pāṭī*, also *Navaśatī* ("having
--   900", for its 900 stanzas, of which 251 are extant).  Śrīdhara is
--   dated 8th–9th century; the dating is disputed and MacTutor gives
--   870–930, so no single year is asserted here.  The same genre runs on
--   through Bhāskara II's *Līlāvatī* (1150).
--
--   *Pāṭī* is the board — and is itself a non-Sanskrit loanword, which
--   is worth saying in a repository whose file-naming rule asks for the
--   source language rather than for Sanskrit specifically.  Calculation
--   was done on dust or sand spread over that board, the operation
--   called *dhūlikarma*, dust-work.  A quantity is SET DOWN, used, and
--   then WIPED so the space can carry the next quantity.  What survives
--   a step is what the operator chose to leave on the board; what is
--   wiped is gone, whatever its mathematical existence.
--
--   That erase-or-retain choice is the stated hypothesis of this
--   repository's addition-chain cache lane, put plainest at
--   notes/ADDITION_CHAIN_PROCESS_MEMORY.md §4 ("The persistence
--   boundary": if the runtime discards every intermediate, both
--   histories become (6,{6}) and no probe separates them).
--   `ls notes/ | grep -i 'cache\|chain'` returns 22 files, but that is
--   a name match and not a subject count — at least three of the 22
--   (TOOLCHAIN_SKEW_AND_COVERAGE, NATURAL_MACHINE_TOOLCHAIN_DRIFT,
--   SEED85_FORMAL_LANE_STATUS_WITHOUT_A_TOOLCHAIN) are about the Agda
--   and Lean toolchain.  No count of the lane is asserted here.
--
--   NOT CLAIMED: that Śrīdhara stated anything about predictive
--   quotients, distance profiles, or congruences.  He did not.  Nor is
--   any addition-chain result below attributed to him.  The term names
--   the operational distinction the board makes concrete, and it is
--   used because a grep of notes/ and formal/ on 2026-08-20 returned
--   ZERO occurrences of *pāṭī*, *Pāṭīgaṇita*, *dhūlikarma* or Śrīdhara,
--   in a corpus whose cache lane turns on exactly the distinction that
--   genre is named for.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS CHECKED HERE
--
--   notes/FLEET_BREAKER_PASS_2026_08_14.md §6.4 refutes the
--   recommendation of notes/EXACT_PREDICTIVE_QUANTUM_MEMORY_NO_GO.md §5
--   ("compile exact cache histories to their profile quotient") by
--   exhibiting a HOMOMETRIC PAIR: two caches, both reachable from {1},
--   with equal distance profiles on the declared family T = {11}, which
--   one exogenous control drives apart.  That witness is stated there in
--   one paragraph of hand arithmetic and, as of this writing, appears
--   nowhere else in the corpus and has never been independently
--   checked.
--
--   Here it is computed rather than asserted.  d_C(t) is the least
--   number of adjoin-a-sum steps until t is in the cache; every bound
--   below is a finite Bool computation closed by refl.
--
--     C = {1,2,4,6}   reached by  1+1, 2+2, 2+4     (legality checked)
--     D = {1,2,3,4}   reached by  1+1, 1+2, 1+3     (legality checked)
--
--     d_C(11) = 2 = d_D(11)                          homometric at {11}
--     u₁₀ C = C ∪ {10},  d(11) = 1                   control fires on C
--     u₁₀ D = D,          d(11) = 2                   control inert on D
--
--   And one thing §6.4 does not say, which is the reason the witness
--   had to look like that:
--
--     d_C(3) = 1  while  d_D(3) = 0
--
--   so the family T = {3,11} separates the pair with NO control at all.
--   The general statement, proved in the companion note and not here
--   (it quantifies over all caches, which this finite module does not):
--
--     if C △ D ⊆ T then Δ_T(C) = Δ_T(D) implies C = D,
--
--   because d_X(t) = 0 exactly when t ∈ X.  So every homometric pair of
--   caches has a separating element OUTSIDE the declared family, and
--   the nontriviality of the profile quotient is a statement about T
--   alone, never about the dynamics.  Both sides are instantiated
--   below: T = {11} where homometry holds, T = {3,11} where it fails.
--
--   No claim is made about optimal chains, about quantum memory, or
--   about the general dichotomy being machine-checked.
