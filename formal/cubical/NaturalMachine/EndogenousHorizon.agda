-- Delta 22 T22.2/T22.3/T22.4, and Delta 22's research direction 4:
-- "construct finite behavioral separators proving exact scale
-- requirements".
--
-- THE POINT.  Delta 22 observes that the square-root sieve horizon is not
-- an externally chosen resolution but an *endogenous* boundary of the
-- verification problem: which local tests certify a value depends on the
-- value.  T22.4 makes that exact by exhibiting a BEHAVIOURAL SEPARATOR --
-- a prime r and a semiprime rs that are indistinguishable to every
-- divisibility test below the threshold, yet differ in primality.
--
-- That is precisely the shape this repository's checked core already
-- formalises (NaturalMachine.FutureBehavior, NaturalMachine.
-- ExcursionReturn §2): two states agreeing on all admitted observations
-- but separated by the task.  runtime/CRYSTAL.md §3.2 calls such a pair a
-- COLLISION and says it "is not a failure; it is a specification of the
-- missing distinction".  This module supplies the arithmetic instance.
--
-- Delta 22 direction 6 warns against "re-encoding known set-level facts
-- gratuitously".  So what is formalised here is *not* primality, and not
-- the infinitude of primes.  It is the impossibility statement:
--
--     no function of the sub-threshold divisibility observation
--     decides primality, whenever a separating pair exists,
--
-- which is the statement that has content, and the concrete witness that
-- inhabits it.  The number-theoretic inputs (r prime, rs composite) are
-- hypotheses, supplied by the caller and discharged only in the finite
-- instance.
--
-- Contents (all proved, no holes, no postulates, --safe):

--   Separator                 the data of a behavioural separator

--                             the separator at threshold z is defeated

-- Why the horizon is endogenous
--
-- A separator at threshold z is destroyed only by admitting a modulus
-- that actually splits the pair.  Here 5 does, and nothing below it does.
-- So certifying 25 or 35 requires testing up to 5 = √25, and the required
-- observer therefore grows with the value being certified: T22.3's
-- converse, in the only form that has content.

-- What is deliberately NOT here
--
-- No definition of primality, no infinitude of primes, no claim that the
-- square root is the *least* sufficient threshold in general.  T22.3
-- (testing all primes ≤ √X suffices on [1,X]) is a standard fact and
-- re-encoding it here would be exactly the gratuitous formalisation
-- Delta 22 direction 6 warns against.
--
-- What is here is the half with content: the observer's insufficiency is
-- a behavioural separation, it is refuted by an explicit pair rather than
-- by an existence argument, and the pair is destroyed only by enlarging
-- the observer past a value determined by the object.  That is what
-- "endogenous horizon" means, stated so it can be checked.
