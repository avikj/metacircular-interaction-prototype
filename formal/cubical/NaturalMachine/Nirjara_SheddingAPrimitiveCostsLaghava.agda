-- NaturalMachine.Nirjara_SheddingAPrimitiveCostsLaghava
--
-- निर्जरा at the level of the vocabulary, and what it costs.
--
-- Tattvārthasūtra 10.1: कevala-jñāna arises from the DESTRUCTION of the
-- obscuring karmas.  Omniscience is not acquired; it is what remains when
-- obscuration is removed.  And 9.19-9.20: nirjarā is brought about by
-- tapas.  Shedding that happens on its own as karma ripens — savipāka —
-- happens to everyone and gains nothing; only avipāka, deliberate and
-- before its time, is a path.
--
-- Taken as given rather than as a model, that says something exact about
-- this repository's engine, which ANEKANTA.md §13 states and does not
-- prove: every organ the engine has ADDS.  `bestOf` names a frequent
-- subterm; concept invention adds a symbol.  Nothing removes one, and the
-- primitives are therefore treated as having svabhāva — the question of
-- whether they carve anything cannot be posed.
--
-- Here is why that will not fix itself, and it is not an oversight in the
-- implementation.  Shedding an INERT primitive — one whose every use is
-- eval-equal to a use-free term — loses no meaning (§2) and does remove
-- the symbol (§3).  But it strictly INCREASES the presentation (§4).  So
-- an engine steered by लाघव can never take the step: brevity opposes
-- nirjarā, always, and savipāka never arrives.  Only tapas removes a
-- primitive, and tapas is by definition the operation you do against the
-- gradient.
--
-- `Laghava.agda` proves cost lives on the presentation and no function of
-- the denotation computes it.  This is that boundary with a direction:
-- the presentation is exactly what nirjarā has to pay.
--
-- CHECKED: exit code quoted in the commit message.  Agda 2.6.3 + cubical
-- v0.5 in this container, which is NOT the repository pin.

-- 5.  तपस् — the three facts as one statement.
--
-- Shedding an inert primitive: preserves the meaning, removes the symbol,
-- and costs brevity.  An engine that grows by adding and is steered by
-- लाघव will therefore never shed one — not because it was built badly,
-- but because the step is against its gradient at every instance.
--
-- सविपाक निर्जरा — shedding that happens on its own — cannot occur here.
-- There is no ripening that removes a symbol; the vocabulary only ever
-- grows.  Only अविपाक, deliberate and against the gradient, does it, and
-- Tattvārthasūtra 9.19-9.20 names that तपस्.

-- 6.  The second obstruction, and it is independent of the first.
--
-- §4 says an engine steered by लाघव will never CHOOSE to shed.  This says
-- it could not FIND what to shed either, and for a different reason.
--
-- The engine inspects what it has proved — equations, i.e. denotations.
-- But an inert primitive leaves no trace there: every meaning reachable
-- with it is reachable without it (§2, §3), so the two presentations sit
-- in the same fibre of `artha` and no function of the meaning can report
-- which one was used.
--
-- This is `Laghava.agda`'s shape a second time.  There, size was invisible
-- to the denotation.  Here, USE OF A SYMBOL is invisible to the
-- denotation — which is worse for the engine, because size at least is
-- something it never needed, while the symbol list is the thing §13 of
-- ANEKANTA.md says it cannot interrogate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- the same meaning, said with the primitive and without it
tulya-artha : artha (dvi cara) ≡ artha (yoga cara cara)
tulya-artha = refl

-- and the two are distinguished by the symbol they use
dvi-yukta-bheda : ¬ (dviYukta (dvi cara) ≡ dviYukta (yoga cara cara))
dvi-yukta-bheda p = true≢false p

-- so nothing computed from the meaning reports the use
prayoga-na-arthasya : ¬ (Σ (Artha → Bool) (λ f → (e : Pada) → f (artha e) ≡ dviYukta e))
prayoga-na-arthasya (f , spec) =
  dvi-yukta-bheda ( sym (spec (dvi cara))

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 7.  The two obstructions together.
--
-- An engine that wanted to shed a primitive would have to (a) choose a
-- step that strictly increases the quantity it minimises, and (b) locate
-- the symbol to shed, from evidence in which the symbol leaves no trace.
--
-- Neither follows from the other.  (a) is about the gradient and would
-- survive perfect detection; (b) is about the evidence and would survive
-- any objective.  Both hold here, and this is a vocabulary with a single
-- redundant symbol — the easiest case there is.
--
-- What the tradition prescribes at exactly this point is not a better
-- objective and not a better sensor.  It is तपस्: the deliberate act
-- against the gradient, undertaken because the obscuration is known to be
-- there and not because anything reported it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 8.  Widening the verdict does not help, and this is the general form.
--
-- §6 refuted a BOOLEAN test of the meaning.  The natural repair in this
-- corpus — the one `Saptabhangi.agda` exists for, and the one
-- ANEKANTA.md §1 argues at length — is to replace the boolean by more
-- positions.  It does not touch this obstruction, and the reason is one
-- line: the failure is the FACTORING, not the arity of the verdict.
--
-- Every function of the meaning whatsoever, into any type at all, agrees
-- on the two presentations.  Seven positions agree; seventy do; a type of
-- proofs does.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

sarva-artha-samam :
  {ℓ : Level} {X : Type ℓ} (g : Artha → X)

sarva-artha-samam g = cong g tulya-artha

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 9.  What DOES license the shedding, and it is of a different kind.
--
-- Not a function of the meaning — §8 closes that off for every target.
-- The licence is `nirjara-artha-aviruddha`: a statement quantified over
-- ALL terms, proved about the syntax, which no evaluation of any
-- particular meaning yields.
--
-- In the inventory of ANEKANTA.md §4 that is not प्रत्यक्ष and not
-- अनुमान.  Both of those, in this engine, run on the accepted set —
-- evaluation of candidates, and inference from equations already held —
-- and both therefore factor through `artha`.  §8 says everything that
-- factors through `artha` is blind here.
--
-- What remains is शब्द: the naya arrives as testimony, and what is
-- transmitted is not a verdict but the ground of one.  `MathMachine.hs`
-- reached the same place for a different reason and recorded it as
-- śabda — a theorem this engine kernel-checked and wrote down is
-- testimony from an āpta, and what that testimony conveys is the NAYA,
-- not the truth value.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED: that śabda is the only route in general.  What is proved
-- is narrower and sufficient for the point — nothing factoring through
-- the denotation can see it, and the thing that does see it is a proof
-- about the syntax rather than a reading of any meaning.
