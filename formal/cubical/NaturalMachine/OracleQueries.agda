-- TARGET.md §6 item 2, answered — and answered in the negative.
--
-- THE QUESTION.  `ChargeCriterion` proves: a query set separates the
-- all-plus sign assignment from its gauge flip IFF it contains a query
-- of odd Ω.  `notes/BARRIER.md` §3 Problem 2 asks for an oracle model
-- distinguishing VALUE queries ("what is a(n)?") from FUNCTIONAL-EQUATION
-- queries ("a(mn)=a(m)a(n), used as a constraint and not as a value").
-- TARGET.md §6 predicts these are "the same distinction stated twice",
-- and says that if they are not, the difference is the finding.
--
-- THEY ARE NOT THE SAME, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS EXACT.  A
-- functional-equation query carries NO charge — not "usually none", not
-- "none unless its arguments are odd": none, unconditionally, at every
-- pair of arguments, including maximally charged ones.  Its answer is
-- the constant `true` on the entire class of completely multiplicative
-- ±1 functions (`fe-const`), so it is simulated exactly by post-processing
-- that ignores the oracle.  Functional-equation access therefore lies
-- strictly INSIDE the blind side of the charge criterion; the two axes are
-- orthogonal, not identical.
--
-- The one-line witness is `p-two-ways`: the SAME odd-Ω argument p
-- separates when read as a value and does not separate when read through
-- the functional equation.  Charge is a property of the READING, not of
-- the argument — which is the sharper form of ChargeCriterion's own
-- "charge lives in what a method reads".
--
-- WHY, STRUCTURALLY (the reason the counterexample had to exist).  The
-- parity charge is the map χ = sgn ∘ Ω, and χ is a MONOID CHARACTER of the
-- factorization monoid: χ(mn) = χ(m)χ(n) (`charge-++`).  The functional
-- equation is precisely the monoid law that χ is a character FOR.  A
-- character cannot be moved by the law it respects, so the kernel of χ —
-- the neutral sector — is closed under everything the functional equation
-- licenses.  That is `Gen-neutral`: the deductive closure of a neutral
-- query set under multiplication AND division is still neutral, hence by
-- `ChargeCriterion.neutral⇒no-separator` still non-separating.  This is
-- the conservation law behind the counterexample: symmetry and conserved
-- quantity are the same statement, and here the symmetry is the gauge
-- flip, the conserved quantity is χ, and the functional equation is a
-- gauge-invariant relation, so it conserves χ identically.
--
-- WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT `BARRIER.md`.  That note's §2 visibility table
-- credits row 3, "functional-equation access", with being "the one known
-- access to Chowla-grade (bulk) content", and its own honesty ledger §4
-- says row 3 rests on "reading Tao's published argument through this lens
-- (no new analysis of it here)".  This module supplies the missing
-- analysis for the parity axis, and it inverts the attribution: the
-- entropy-decrement step uses λ(pn) = −λ(n), which is the functional
-- equation SPECIALIZED AT A KNOWN VALUE λ(p) = −1 — a value query at
-- Ω = 1, i.e. the single maximally charged reading there is.  By the
-- charge criterion that value is what puts the method on the separating
-- side.  The equation contributes exactly zero charge; the value
-- contributes all of it.  So "functional-equation access" is not a third
-- interface with more parity power — it is the neutral monoid law plus a
-- charged value query, and only the second half is doing work.
--
-- CONSEQUENCE FOR W3 (BARRIER Problem 1 / TARGET §2 W3).  W3 asks to prove
-- that no post-processing of value queries simulates functional-equation
-- queries.  On the parity axis that is FALSE and this module refutes it:
-- FE queries are simulated by the constant `true`, using no queries at
-- all (`fe-simulated-by-constant`).  The separation, if there is one,
-- must run the other way and must be about the functional equation as an
-- INFERENCE RULE applied to a charged seed — not about it as a query type.
--
-- Contents (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   val-++, Ω-++, sgn-+       val and Ω are monoid homomorphisms
--   charge-++                 χ = sgn ∘ Ω is a monoid CHARACTER
--   Query, ans                the two-interface oracle of BARRIER §3(2)
--   fe-const                  every FE answer is `true`, for every σ
--   fe-simulated-by-constant  hence FE queries have a query-free simulator
--   Neutral, AllNeutral       charge of a query; FE queries: always neutral
--   neutralQ⇒no-separator     neutral transcripts are equal, so no decision
--   fe-blind                  an ALL-FE query set never separates, however
--                             charged its arguments
--   p-two-ways                THE FINDING: one odd-Ω argument, two
--                             readings, opposite verdicts
--   Gen, Gen-sound            the FE deductive closure, and that it really
--                             is a closure (it determines values)
--   Gen-neutral               CONSERVATION: closure of neutral is neutral
--   closure-no-separator      hence FE inference cannot manufacture a
--                             separator from neutral readings
--
-- NOT claimed: that this says anything about BARRIER.md's OTHER axis, the
-- depth/correlation barrier of Theorem K.  The model here is the parity
-- observable class of `ParitySeparator`, and every statement is about
-- separating σ₊ from its gauge flip.  Whether the value/FE distinction is
-- also empty for the windowed-linear class is untouched here.
--
-- NOT claimed either: that entropy decrement is thereby "explained" or
-- weakened.  Its content is quantitative (logarithmic averaging, the
-- decrement bound); the claim here is only about where its parity charge
-- enters, which is a question about its interface and not about its
-- strength.

-- assignments agreeing on S agree on all of `Gen S`, so the values there
-- are genuinely determined and nothing is being assumed.
--
-- `Gen-neutral` is then the conservation law: the closure of a neutral
