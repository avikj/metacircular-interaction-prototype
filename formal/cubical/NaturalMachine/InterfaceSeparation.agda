-- NaturalMachine.InterfaceSeparation
--
-- W3 of `TARGET.md` §2 = `notes/BARRIER.md` §2's closing demand:
--
--     "a proof that no WL post-processing Φ can simulate that interface
--      — i.e., a separation, not just a classification."
--
-- The interface in question is `BARRIER.md`'s third presentation:
-- FUNCTIONAL-EQUATION ACCESS, "a(np) = a(n)a(p) used as a *constraint*,
-- not a value", which is the interface Tao's entropy decrement consumes
-- and which the windowed-linear class WL declines by construction —
-- WL "treats a as a black-box sequence".
--
-- THE ANSWER IS A DICHOTOMY, AND THE DICHOTOMY IS THE RESULT.  W3 is not
-- one question.  It is two, with OPPOSITE answers, and which one you are
-- asking is fixed by a single modelling choice that `BARRIER.md` makes
-- silently:
--
--   * PROMISED MODEL — the hidden object is a completely multiplicative
--     ±1 function (a sign assignment on the primes; `ParitySeparator`'s
--     `Signs`).  Then **W3 IS FALSE**: functional-equation access is
--     exactly simulated by post-processing of value queries, and the
--     simulator is CONSTRUCTED here (`compile`, `derived-simulated`).
--     The functional equation is an identity on this class, so an
--     FE CHECK carries zero bits (`fe-promised-constant`), and an
--     FE REWRITE — deriving a(mn) from a(m), a(n) — is a computation on
--     the transcript and nothing more.  Whatever entropy decrement's
--     advantage over WL is, it is NOT that it queries a channel the
--     value oracle lacks.
--
--   * UNPROMISED MODEL — the hidden object is an arbitrary ±1 sequence,
--     which is what "black-box sequence" literally says.  Then **W3 IS
--     TRUE**, and provably so at the smallest nontrivial scale: no
--     post-processing of ANY value-query set that misses the product
--     point determines even one FE bit (`value-cannot-simulate-fe`),
--     however many queries it makes and however non-computable the
--     post-processing is.  Three value queries AT the right points do
--     simulate it (`fe-simulated-when-product-queried`).
--
-- So the content of the functional-equation interface is exactly THE
-- PROMISE (`fe-content-is-the-promise`): it is nonconstant on sequences
-- and constant on multiplicative ones.  A separation theorem for it is
-- available, but it separates "may I assume multiplicativity?" from
-- "must I verify it?", not "value channel" from "constraint channel".
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT A MODEL CHOSEN TO MAKE A THEOREM EASY.  Both models
-- are formalised here and both theorems are proved; neither is assumed.
-- The hostile reader's move is named in `notes/INTERFACE_SEPARATION.md`
-- §6 and it is the right one: attack the claim that a finite-query
-- oracle model is the right home for entropy decrement at all, since
-- that argument's actual input is an AVERAGED statement over all n at
-- once.  This module proves what a query model can decide and says so.
--
-- WHAT IS NEW HERE relative to the two modules it builds on.
-- `ParitySeparator` (cf-sakshi) proves neutral observers cannot separate
-- σ from its gauge flip; `ChargeCriterion` (cf-sakshi) upgrades that to
-- an iff on the query set.  Both fix the interface and vary the object.
-- This module fixes the object and VARIES THE INTERFACE, which is what
-- an oracle separation is, and adds the one arithmetic corollary that
-- matters to the barrier program:
--
--     `fe-closure-cannot-separate` — closing a parity-neutral query set
--     under the functional equation NEVER produces a charged query.
--
-- That is "no post-processing manufactures charge" upgraded from a slogan
-- to a structural induction over the syntax of derivations, in the same
-- shape as `NaturalMachine.FlipObservable`'s grammar-blindness theorem.

-- §0  What an oracle separation IS, once post-processing is arbitrary.
--
-- An interface on a hidden object of type O is a map O → A: the whole
-- transcript it produces.  Post-processing is any function A → B, with
-- no computability, continuity or measurability demanded — this is
-- `BARRIER.md` Proposition B3's "arbitrary, even non-computable Φ",
-- taken literally, and it is the strongest form of the hypothesis.
--
-- Hence simulation is not a complexity statement; it is a statement
-- about PARTITIONS.  I simulates J exactly when I's transcript refines
-- J's, and the only way to refute it is to exhibit a COLLISION of I
-- that J splits.  Because the object space here is free — arbitrary
-- sign assignments on the primes, `TARGET.md` §3's whole reason to
-- attack parity rather than ζ — collisions can be constructed, not
-- hunted for.  That is the diagonalisation, and §4 performs it.

--
-- A number is its multiset of prime factors (`ParitySeparator.Number` =
-- List ℕ), so MULTIPLICATION IS CONCATENATION and the functional
-- equation a(mn) = a(m)a(n) reads a(m ++ n) = a m · a n.  The FE query
-- is the DEFECT of that identity — the same triple (x, y, x+y) the

-- so: recovering a(n) from a(mn) and a(m) is `mul`, because {±1} has
-- exponent two.  Stated because "your calculus only multiplies" is the
-- first objection to §3, and it is answered by the group, not by fiat.

-- §3  PROMISED MODEL, second half: FE REWRITING IS POST-PROCESSING.
--
-- This is the half that decides W3, and the trivial reading of §2 does
-- not settle it.  The substantive use of the functional equation is not
-- to CHECK it but to REWRITE with it: to obtain a(mn) from a(m) and
-- a(n) — which is exactly how entropy decrement moves information from
-- a scale to a dilate of that scale, and exactly what the windowed class
-- cannot do, since a window [1,X] is not closed under multiplication.
--
-- The theorem is that this buys nothing over the value queries already
-- made.  `Deriv` is the syntax of FE rewriting: a query already asked
-- (`var i`), the empty product (`unit`), or the product of two
-- derivations (`mul`).  `target` says which number a derivation names;
-- `post` is the post-processing that computes its value FROM THE
-- TRANSCRIPT ALONE, by structural recursion on the same syntax; and
-- `compile` proves them equal for every σ.
--
-- So every value the FE interface can derive is a function of the value
-- transcript.  `derived-simulated` states that as a simulation.  W3 is
-- FALSE in the promised model, and not narrowly: the simulator is
-- explicit, total, and computes.

-- character — so a derivation from even-Ω queries has even-Ω target.
-- Therefore the FE closure of a parity-neutral query set is parity-
-- neutral, and by `ChargeCriterion.neutral⇒no-separator` still admits no
-- separator at all.
--
-- This is the sharp form of `TARGET.md` §4b's asymmetry ("charge lives
-- in what a method reads, and no amount of computation on neutral
-- readings manufactures it"): the functional equation is a computation
-- on neutral readings, and it is now proved not to manufacture charge.
