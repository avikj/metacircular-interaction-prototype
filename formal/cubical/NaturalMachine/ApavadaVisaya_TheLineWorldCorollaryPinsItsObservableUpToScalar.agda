-- अपवादविषय — *the scope of the exception*.  उत्सर्ग / अपवाद, the general
-- rule and the special rule that blocks it, is Pāṇini's (Aṣṭādhyāyī,
-- c. 500 BCE); विषय, the domain over which a rule actually applies, is the
-- commentators' term for the question this module answers (Patañjali,
-- Mahābhāṣya, c. 150 BCE, uses it throughout for a rule's field of
-- application).  NOT CLAIMED: that Pāṇini or Patañjali proved anything
-- about ℤ/p, transport, or p-adic worlds.  The Sanskrit names the SHAPE
-- of the question — *a special rule was promoted to a general one; what
-- exactly was its scope?* — because the grammarians posed that question
-- as a technical one and this corpus has been posing it informally.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS, AND TO WHAT
--
-- `notes/ENCOUNTERED_WORLDS.md` §3.5 states, and proves:
--
--   **Theorem.**  If `T_E(x)` is a linear subspace `L ⊆ (ℤ/p)^n`, then
--   transport at `x` ⟺ `grad f(x)|_L` is not identically zero.
--
--   **Corollary (line worlds).**  For `f = X+Y` and `E = {(a, sa)}`, the
--   tangent set is `span{(1,s)}` and `grad f|_L (t) = t(1+s)`.  So `E`
--   transports **iff `s ≠ -1 (mod p)`**.
--
-- `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_5.md` §C2 records that a summary message dropped
-- the two words "For `f = X+Y`" under a Theorem quantified over all
-- integral `f`.  `NaturalMachine.LineWorldTransport` makes the corollary's
-- hypothesis part of a type, and exhibits ONE counterexample to the
-- dropped reading: for `f = X`, `grad f|_L(t) = t`, so every line world
-- transports, at `s = -1` included.
-- `NaturalMachine.Control.QuantifierDrop` is the must-fail control.
--
-- The corpus therefore records: *there exists an `f` for which the
-- corollary fails.*  It does not record HOW MANY, or WHICH.  That is the
-- अपवादविषय question, and it has an exact answer at every prime.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE THEOREM, FOR EVERY PRIME (written proof; §4 below checks p = 5
-- exhaustively as a closed computation)
--
-- Let `p` be prime, `f = c₁X + c₂Y` a linear observable over ℤ/p, and
-- `E = {(a, sa)}`.  By §3.5's Theorem, `E` transports iff
-- `grad f|_L ≢ 0`, i.e. iff `c₁ + c₂ s ≢ 0 (mod p)`.  Write
--
--     Z(f) = { s ∈ ℤ/p : c₁ + c₂ s ≡ 0 }.
--
-- The corollary asserts `transports ⟺ s ≢ -1`, so corollary and truth
-- agree at every slope exactly when `Z(f) = {-1}`.
--
--   * `c₂ ≠ 0`.  ℤ/p is a field, so `c₁ + c₂ s = 0` has the unique root
--     `s = -c₁c₂⁻¹` and `Z(f)` is a singleton.  It is `{-1}` iff
--     `-c₁c₂⁻¹ = -1`, i.e. iff `c₁ = c₂`.
--   * `c₂ = 0`, `c₁ ≠ 0`.  `Z(f) = ∅ ≠ {-1}`.
--   * `c₂ = c₁ = 0`.  `Z(f) = ℤ/p ≠ {-1}`, since `p ≥ 2`.
--
--     **The line-world corollary holds for `f = c₁X + c₂Y` if and only
--     if `c₁ = c₂ ≠ 0`** — that is, iff `f` is a NONZERO SCALAR MULTIPLE
--     of `X+Y`.                                                      ∎
--
-- So the hypothesis "For `f = X+Y`" is not merely sufficient.  Within the
-- linear family it is **necessary, and it pins `f` up to a scalar**: the
-- corollary is a complete characterisation of its own observable.  The
-- dropped-quantifier reading is false on exactly `p² - (p-1)` of the `p²`
-- linear observables — 21 of 25 at `p = 5`.
--
-- This strictly strengthens `LineWorldTransport.dropped-hypothesis-false`,
-- which exhibits one witness.  It does not correct it; it locates it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHERE PRIMALITY ENTERS, AND TWO LITERATURES THAT SAY SO
--
-- §3.5's proof turns on one step: *"`{grad f(x)·h : h ∈ L}` is a subgroup
-- of ℤ/p, hence `{0}` or all of ℤ/p."*  That dichotomy is primality and
-- nothing else.  In ℤ/N with `N` composite, a nonzero `g` generates the
-- subgroup of index `gcd(g,N)`, so transport can fail with `grad ≢ 0`:
-- at `N = 4`, `g = 2`, target `3`, the attainable set is `{0,2}` and `3`
-- is not in it.  This is not a correction to §3.5 — the note is p-adic
-- throughout — it is a statement of where its hypothesis is load-bearing.
--
-- Both of this session's assigned literatures had to confront exactly the
-- composite case the corpus never enters, and each records a result:
--
--   * **Music and tuning theory.**  A cyclic division into `N` steps, and
--     a fixed interval of `g` steps: the chain of that interval visits
--     `N / gcd(g,N)` pitch classes and then closes.  The tradition works
--     at composite `N` and therefore had to face this.  Bharata,
--     *Nāṭyaśāstra* ch. 28 (c. 200 BCE – 200 CE) establishes the 22
--     śrutis by the *sāraṇā* procedure — two vīṇās identically tuned, one
--     displaced one śruti at a time, coincidences observed; the fourfold
--     form *sāraṇā-catuṣṭaya* is set out in Abhinavagupta's
--     *Abhinavabhāratī* (c. 1000 CE) at NŚ 28.26.  On the resulting
--     4-3-2-4-4-3-2 division, ṣaḍja and pañcama are separated by 13 of
--     the 22 steps, and `gcd(13,22) = 1`, so the chain of pañcamas
--     exhausts all 22; a chain of 4 steps has `gcd(4,22) = 2` and closes
--     early into two disjoint circles.  Śārṅgadeva,
--     *Saṅgītaratnākara* I (c. 1210–1247 CE), tabulates the division.
--     NOT CLAIMED: that any of these texts states the gcd law as a
--     theorem, or that śruti intervals are equal steps of a cyclic group
--     — the 22 are not equal and the equal-step reading is a modern
--     idealisation.  What is claimed is that the tradition worked the
--     composite case and recorded which chains close and which exhaust.
--   * **Quantum information.**  Qudit stabilizer theory over ℤ/d: for `d`
--     an ODD PRIME every non-identity Weyl–Heisenberg displacement
--     generates a maximal abelian subgroup of order `d`, and this is why
--     the contextuality-as-a-resource results are stated for odd prime
--     dimension — Howard, Wallman, Veitch, Emerson, *Contextuality
--     supplies the "magic" for quantum computation*, Nature **510** (2014)
--     351–355.  The restriction is the same dichotomy, declared as a
--     hypothesis rather than used silently.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
--
-- It does NOT widen `LineWorldTransport.Obs` from two constructors to the
-- full linear family, although that is where the mathematics wants to
-- live.  `Obs` is the quantification domain of the must-fail control
-- `Control/QuantifierDrop.agda`, whose designed failure is pinned to a
-- verbatim error message under two toolchains
-- (`notes/PIN_SWEEP_NATURALMACHINE.md` §4, Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9;
-- and the container, Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5).  Adding constructors to
-- `Obs` changes how `transports f s` reduces on an open `f` and can move
-- or destroy that error site.  So this module IMPORTS `Slope`, `mod5`,
-- `attains`, `crit`, `eqℕ` and works over its own `Lin`; every statement
-- below is about the corpus's own `attains` and `crit`, not about copies.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 — the CONTAINER toolchain, which
-- `formal/cubical/BUILD.md` §"Version-skew notes" records as skewed from
-- the repository pin (2.8.0 + v0.9).  Not verified under the pin.
-- No postulates, no holes.

-- 1.  THE FULL LINEAR OBSERVABLE FAMILY over ℤ/5.
--
-- `LineWorldTransport.Obs` carries two observables, the two the audit
-- contrasted.  A linear observable `f = c₁X + c₂Y` is exactly its pair of
-- gradient coefficients, and over ℤ/5 there are 25 of them.  Coefficients
-- are reused as `Slope` because both range over ℤ/5.

Lin = Slope × Slope

-- `grad f|_L(1) = c₁ + c₂·s`, the same computation as
-- `LineWorldTransport.grad`, over the full family.

-- 2.  सारणा — WHICH CHAINS EXHAUST THE CYCLE.
--
-- `attains g` asks whether the target `-1 = 4` lies in `{t·g : t ∈ ℤ/5}`,
-- i.e. whether the chain of the interval `g` reaches a given step of the
-- cycle.  At a PRIME modulus the answer is degenerate: every nonzero
-- interval exhausts the cycle, so `attains` is just "`g` is nonzero".
--
-- This is the whole content of §3.5's step "hence `{0}` or all of ℤ/p",
-- and it is where primality does its work.  In the tuning literature the
-- modulus is composite (12, 22) and the corresponding statement is the
-- gcd law, which does not degenerate; see the header.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6.  THE SENTENCE.
--
-- The dropped hypothesis was not a hypothesis that happened to be needed.
-- It was a complete description of the corollary's viṣaya: the criterion
-- `s ≢ -1` is correct for a linear observable if and only if that
-- observable is a nonzero scalar multiple of the one named in the
-- hypothesis.  Dropping "For `f = X+Y`" from the corollary does not
-- overreach by a margin.  It overreaches onto 21 of 25 observables at
-- `p = 5`, and onto `p² - (p-1)` of `p²` at every prime, in `p²-p+1`
-- distinct failure shapes at most — one per distinct zero-set of a
-- linear form, plus the constant.
--
-- `Control/QuantifierDrop.agda` is therefore testing a maximal claim: the
-- statement it asserts is false as widely as a statement of that form can
-- be, and remains false however `Obs` is enlarged inside the linear
-- family, since the corollary's truth set is fixed at four observables.
