-- Factory IV §XI — "the projectors commute; the information does not" —
-- at the type level.
--
-- WHERE THIS COMES FROM.  The owner's delta
-- `collab/upstream/library/raw/ETERNAL_GOLDEN_BRAID_THEOREM_FACTORY_IV_2026-08-14.md`
-- §XI observes that the two extractions defining the hard corner of the
-- prime-pair field — P_r (radius one) and P_c (factorization charge one)
-- — commute as operators, P_r P_c = P_c P_r, so the twin corner is NOT
-- an operator-noncommutation obstruction.  And yet the two known
-- recurrence statements (charge-one mass summed over radii ≤ 123 is
-- infinite — Maynard's side; radius-one mass at charge ≤ 2 is infinite —
-- Chen's side) do not imply recurrence of the JOINT corner P_r P_c 𝒞,
-- because "a nonnegative field may place all exact-prime mass at radius
-- two and all radius-one mass at charge two."  The true problem is a
-- marginal-to-joint lower-bound problem.  Receiving audit:
-- `notes/FACTORY_IV_CHEN_CORNER_AUDIT.md`.  Factory I sibling
-- (`UNIVALENT_PERSPECTIVAL_THEOREM_FACTORY_DELTA_14_2026-08-13.md` §A,
-- T14.6/C14.7) carries the same shape one level up: an ambient
-- equivalence restricts to a sector precisely when the sector predicate
-- is invariant — selection, not conjugation, is where information dies.
--
-- THE NOETHER READING.  Boolean predicates on witnesses act on witness
-- lists by filtering, and pointwise predicates generate a COMMUTATIVE
-- monoid of such actions: composition of filters is filtering by the
-- pointwise conjunction (`filter-and`, an action identity), and the
-- conjunction is commutative, so the actions commute (`filters-commute`
-- — the general lemma, then `projectors-commute`, its instance at
-- radius/charge).  The invariant that the group-theoretic bookkeeping
-- does NOT control is the joint mass: knowing the orbit of each
-- projector separately (both marginals inhabited) fixes nothing about
-- their meet.  That failure is not argued but CONSTRUCTED: a two-witness
-- world, Factory IV's own, where each marginal filter returns a
-- nonempty list and both orders of the joint filter return [].
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   Witness                a radius r : ℕ together with a leg
--                          n : Number (ParitySeparator's factor
--                          multiset; Ω = length)
--   radiusOne, chargeOne   the two Boolean projectors: r ≡ᵇ 1 (by a
--                          recursive decidable equality defined here)
--                          and ChenProjector's (1−λ)/2
--   filter-and             filtering twice is filtering by the
--                          pointwise conjunction
--   filters-commute        hence ANY two pointwise filters commute —
--                          Boolean and-commutativity lifted to lists
--   projectors-commute     Factory IV §XI's boxed identity
--                          P_r P_c = P_c P_r, as the instance
--                          filterR (filterC ws) ≡ filterC (filterR ws)
--   theWorld               the counterexample field: one prime leg at
--                          radius 2, one charge-two leg at radius 1
--   charge-marginal,       both marginals evaluate, by refl, to
--   radius-marginal        nonempty lists (and are proved ≢ [])
--   corner-empty,          both orders of the joint filter evaluate,
--   corner-empty'          by refl, to []
--   marginal-to-joint-gap  the three facts bundled: this is the gap
--                          made checkable — commutation holds, and the
--                          marginals still say nothing about the joint
--
-- NOT claimed: any recurrence statement.  Chen's and Maynard's theorems
-- are cited analytic inputs about the integers; nothing here inhabits
-- an infinite family of witnesses, and `theWorld` is a two-element
-- field, exactly what §XI's "may place" licenses and no more.  Not
-- claimed either: that the gap is essential — §XI itself says the
-- missing theorem must create positive dependence between the radius
-- and charge events, and this module fixes precisely what such a
-- theorem would have to exclude, namely worlds like `theWorld` at
-- scale.  The commutation half shows the obstruction is not algebraic;
-- the counterexample half shows what it is instead: marginals do not
-- bound joints.  Nothing more is asserted.
