-- NaturalMachine.ParitySeparator
--
-- The sieve parity barrier, as a behavioural separator — elementary,
-- finite, and with no operator algebra in it.
--
-- WHERE THIS COMES FROM.  `notes/GAUGE.md` Theorem F proves that the
-- unique KMS state of the critical affine system annihilates every
-- gauge-charged observable, so "sieves cannot see parity" is an exact
-- invariance rather than a want of technique.  That proof is three lines
-- ON TOP OF Cuntz's uniqueness theorem, which is deep, and the note says
-- so: "the proof is short because Cuntz's uniqueness theorem is deep".
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS.  The arithmetic core of that no-go needs none of
-- it.  Strip the C*-algebra and what is left is a statement about two
-- completely multiplicative ±1 functions that no neutral observation can
-- tell apart — a COLLISION, in the sense `runtime/CRYSTAL.md` §3.2 gives
-- the word: "not a failure; it is a specification of the missing
-- distinction."  `NaturalMachine.EndogenousHorizon` already carries that
-- shape for trial division (Delta 22 T22.4).  This module carries it for
-- parity, which is the one that blocks Goldbach and twin primes.
--
-- THE STATEMENT.  A completely multiplicative ±1 function is exactly a
-- sign assignment σ on the primes; a number is its multiset of prime
-- factors, so Ω(n) is a length.  Let σ' be σ with EVERY prime sign
-- flipped.  Then
--
--     val σ' n  =  (-1)^{Ω(n)} · val σ n,
--
-- so σ and σ' agree at every n of even Ω and differ at every n of odd Ω.
-- An observer restricted to even-Ω arguments — the neutral sector, which
-- is where Theorem F says the equilibrium lives — therefore returns
-- literally the same data on both, and no post-processing whatsoever can
-- separate them.  That is `no-decision` below, and its proof is `cong`:
-- the two observation vectors are not merely close, they are equal.
--
-- WHY THE FLIP IS THE RIGHT ADVERSARY.  σ ↦ σ' is the gauge action of
-- the element (-1,-1,-1,…) of GAUGE.md §F.1's torus — the single group
-- element whose character is exactly the parity grading.  So this is
-- Theorem F's mechanism, at the one point of the torus that matters,
-- with the equilibrium argument replaced by an equality of finite lists.
--
-- Contents (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   Signs, val                 completely multiplicative ±1 functions,
--                              as sign assignments evaluated on factor
--                              multisets
--   flip                       the parity gauge element
--   flip-law                   val σ' n = (-1)^{Ω(n)} · val σ n
--   neutral-blind              even Ω ⇒ the two agree
--   charged-separates          odd Ω ⇒ the two differ, everywhere
--   obs, obs-agree             an observer's whole transcript on even-Ω
--                              queries is EQUAL for σ and σ'
--   no-decision                hence no decision procedure on that
--                              transcript can separate them
--   the-missing-distinction    …and one odd-Ω query does separate them,
--                              so the collision specifies its own repair
--
-- NOT claimed: that this proves anything Bombieri (1976) or
-- Friedlander–Iwaniec (1998) did not.  The parity obstruction is theirs.
-- What is contributed is that its core is a two-element orbit of a group
-- action and can be checked rather than argued — which is what lets the
-- next question ("which observables carry charge?") be posed as a
-- membership problem instead of a methodological caution.
--
-- NOT claimed either: that "even Ω" is the exact neutral sector for every
-- sieve.  It is the neutral sector for the parity grading, which is the
-- grading the barrier is about.  A sieve reads more than parity-neutral
-- data, and the separation above only bites on the parity-charged part —
-- which is precisely the part the barrier concerns.
