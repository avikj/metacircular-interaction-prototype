--
-- PROVENANCE OF THE MATHEMATICS.  Not Indian, not Carolinian, and not
-- mine.  It is this repository's, from three artifacts:
--
--   * notes/DSO_QUERY_EXTENSION_BOUNDARY.md (codex-random-shannon-16,
--     2026-08-14) — the numbers [1,1] / [2,4] / [1,1,101] / [2,4,0] are
--     that note's own, verbatim, from its two tables.  It states the
--     phenomenon in prose and executes it as a GHC regression
--     (`checkDSOQueryExtension` in machine/MathMachine.hs, returning
--     `Left ["true/direct"]`).  It was never checked.  This module
--     checks it.
--   * collab/messages/workers/20260812T144712.509661Z--codex_quantum_process--0007.md
--     — "next action ≠ f(scalar remainder)": three states sharing one
--     visible invariant carry three future-response laws.  §2 below is
--     that shape at its smallest: `partial` is the visible invariant,
--     {s₁,s₂} is a fiber of it, and `full` splits the fiber.  That
--     message fenced its own bound ("exact for this three-state
--     witness, not for all Smith states"); §4 is why the fence was
--     right.
--   * machinery/test_changed_domain_separation.py (codex-ananta) — the
--     minimal changed domain is not a function of the block graph, nor
--     of the labelled block graph.  Same shape: a coarse invariant that
--     is not a sufficient statistic for the question asked of it.
--
-- ON THE NAME.  *vikalādeśa* — the partial statement, made from one
-- standpoint (naya) — against *sakalādeśa*, the total statement, which
-- is pramāṇa.  Malliṣeṇa, *Syādvādamañjarī*, 1292 CE; the distinction is
-- already carried in this corpus by notes/ANEKANTA_THE_MACHINE_HAS_
-- THREE_STANDPOINTS.md and formal/cubical/SaptabhangiNaya.agda, which
-- use it for expressibility and the seven-fold predication.  The object
-- here is different: an ORDERING VERDICT issued under a partial
-- standpoint.  Per CLAUDE.md's file-naming note 3, stated plainly:
-- Malliṣeṇa proved nothing about cost profiles, domination, or lists of
-- observations, and no theorem below is attributed to him.  The word
-- names the object — a verdict that holds under one declared standpoint
-- and is not a property of what it is a verdict about.  If a reader
-- judges the name as over-claiming, it is a rename away and the offer
-- stands.  The received name for the order on profiles is Pareto's; it
-- is used nowhere below, where the relation is called `dominates`.
--
-- THE ANCIENT FIELD, AND WHAT IT DID NOT GIVE.  Assigned: Polynesian
-- and Micronesian navigation.  The procedure, with source and date.
-- Thomas Gladwin, *East Is a Big Bird: Navigation and Logic on Puluwat
-- Atoll*, Harvard University Press, 1970, from the navigator Hipour of
-- the Weriyeng school; David Lewis, *We, the Navigators*, University
-- Press of Hawaii, 1972.  The horizon is divided into 32 points, one
-- for each rising and each setting of a named star, a point being
-- *paafu* in Satawalese.  In *etak* the canoe is held stationary and a
-- reference island, chosen off to one side of the course and usually
-- below the horizon, is taken to slide backwards under the successive
-- star points; the passage is divided into etak segments and the
-- running count is the position.  Ben Finney's 1976 Hōkūleʻa voyage
-- from Hawaiʻi to Tahiti, navigated by Mau Piailug of Satawal, is what
-- put the practice on record outside the Carolines; nothing here
-- depends on it.  Sourcing grade: neither book was opened in this
-- container; the facts above are cited, not read.
--
-- What it gave: §5, and only §5.  A bearing family is a DECLARED FINITE
-- FAMILY whose size fixes a resolution, and two headings inside one
-- point are not separated by it.  That is the one feature used, and it
-- is used as an instance, not as a source.
--
-- What it did NOT give, stated plainly because a reported negative is a
-- result: nothing in §§1–4.  The 32 of the star compass is not used —
-- §5 checks 1 point against 3, because the content is refinement and
-- not the number.  Etak segments are equal in bearing-change and
-- unequal in distance, with the navigator's judgement of speed and
-- current an input this module has no slot for.  Reading wave
-- interference — refracted and reflected swell behind an island — was
-- in the assigned field and produced nothing here whatever.  No
-- navigator stated any theorem in this file and none is claimed for
-- them.  A sibling module already carries etak
-- (NaturalMachine.Prastara_TheGaugeStreamCostsZeroCarriedBitsAndInvisibilityIsWeakerThanGauge,
-- cf-tessera-j-1, message 2156); this is not a restatement of it, and
-- that module's open question — how big a separating family has to be —
-- is not answered here either.  §§3–4 answer a different one: the
-- verdicts a family issues are not monotone in the family even though
-- its separations are.
--
-- WHAT IS REFUTED, AND IT IS MINE.  Reading the drawn material through
-- "the units you assumed were individuals may be collaborations", the
-- natural claim is that the number of behaviours hiding inside a
-- visible state is a property of the object, so a verdict separating
-- two of them cannot be undone by looking harder.  Written out:
-- `DominationSurvivesEveryExtension`.  `myClaimIsFalse` kills it, on
-- the drawn note's own four numbers.  `dominates-ext-same` is the true
-- lemma that makes the false one tempting, and is proved first so the
-- temptation is on the page.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here is about quantum memory, Hilbert
-- dimension, or the Smith states of the 0007 message; §2's fiber is a
-- three-element toy and the bound in that message is its author's, for
-- its own witness family.  No general theorem is proved about when a
-- declared family is complete — `full` is checked complete on ONE
-- three-element type by nine cases, which is a verification and not a
-- criterion.  `countSurvivors` is a count over a two-element archive;
-- no claim is made that survivor counts are non-monotone in general,
-- only that they are not monotone, which one witness settles.
