-- Γ↝ IS A SEARCH, NOT AN ORACLE
--
-- `NaturalMachine.Residual` proves
--
--   Γ↝-never-worse : Γ↝ wHere ns ≤ wHere
--   Γ↝-sound       : Γ↝ wHere ns < wHere → Σ[ n ∈ Neighbour A ] (work n < wHere)
--
-- The second statement is strictly weaker than its own proof.  The proof
-- walks `ns` and hands back a cell of that list; the TYPE says only that a
-- neighbour exists somewhere in the universe of neighbours.  A reader who
-- has the type and not the proof term cannot tell the search from an oracle
-- that guesses a better presentation out of nothing -- and the difference
-- between those two is the whole content of the fifth response.
--
-- This module supplies the missing index.  With list membership made
-- explicit, four statements pin Γ↝ down completely:
--
--   Γ↝-sound-any     the witness is IN the list that was searched;
--   Γ↝-optimal       Γ↝ is a lower bound for every listed neighbour;
--   Γ↝-never-worse   (from Residual) it is a lower bound for staying home;
--   Γ↝-greatest      it is the GREATEST such lower bound;
--   Γ↝-attained      and it is attained -- by home, or by a listed route.
--
-- Together: Γ↝ wHere ns is the minimum of {wHere} ∪ {route n | n ∈ ns},
-- certified as a minimum, not merely as some small number.
--
-- RELATION TO THE DSO LANE (stated because it is a rediscovery, not a
-- discovery).  `_⊓_` of `Residual` is, symbol for symbol, `min₂` of
-- `NaturalMachine.DSOBellmanFinite`, and it is the ℕ-fibre of `minC` of
-- `NaturalMachine.DSOMinPlusFinite` restricted along `fin`.  `Γ↝` is that
-- lane's `foldMin` with `List (Neighbour A)` in place of the finite index
-- `Ix n`, and with `wHere` -- the cost of staying home -- in place of the
-- unit `∞`; `route n = detour (out n) (back n) (work n)` is a `⊗`-product
-- of edge weights, so `Γ↝` is a one-step `bellman` over the neighbour
-- relation.  The DSO lane got there first and got further on the algebra
-- (associativity, `⊗`-distributivity, the `⋆`-monoid, `bellman-compose`);
-- what is new here is only the direction this module adds, namely that the
-- fold's value is witnessed by a member of the structure folded over --
-- which `DSOMinPlusFinite.Argmin` already records for `foldMin`, as a
-- record rather than as a theorem.  The two lanes are one operator and
-- should eventually be one module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Cubical v0.7's `Cubical.Data.List` (Base / Properties / Dependent /
-- FinData) has no `Any` and no `_∈_`, so the predicate is defined here.
-- The tail constructor is named `later` rather than the customary `there`
-- because `Residual` re-exports the field `there : Neighbour A →
-- Presentation` via `open Neighbour public`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (Γ2′)  Same hypothesis as `Γ↝-sound`, indexed conclusion.

-- original proof always had and never published.
Γ↝-sound-member :
    {A : Presentation} (wHere : Work) (ns : List (Neighbour A))
  → Γ↝ wHere ns < wHere
  → Σ[ n ∈ Neighbour A ] ((n ∈ ns) × (work n < wHere))

-- 2.  Γ↝ is a lower bound for every listed neighbour
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- (Γ3)  Not merely small: below every route on offer.
Γ↝-optimal :
    {A : Presentation} (wHere : Work) (ns : List (Neighbour A))
    (n : Neighbour A) → n ∈ ns
  → Γ↝ wHere ns ≤ route n
Γ↝-optimal wHere _ n (here {x = m} {xs = ms} p) =
  subst (λ q → (route m ⊓ Γ↝ wHere ms) ≤ route q) p
        (⊓-≤-left (route m) (Γ↝ wHere ms))
Γ↝-optimal wHere _ n (later {x = m} {xs = ms} a) =
  ≤-trans (⊓-≤-right (route m) (Γ↝ wHere ms))
          (Γ↝-optimal wHere ms n a)

-- (Γ4)  And the greatest lower bound: anything below home and below every
-- listed route is below Γ↝.  With Γ↝-never-worse and Γ↝-optimal this is the
-- universal property, so `Γ↝ wHere ns` IS min ({wHere} ∪ route ⟨ns⟩).
Γ↝-greatest :
    {A : Presentation} (wHere : Work) (ns : List (Neighbour A)) (c : Cost)
  → c ≤ wHere
  → ((n : Neighbour A) → n ∈ ns → c ≤ route n)
  → c ≤ Γ↝ wHere ns

-- 3.  The value is attained

-- A minimum over a finite set is not an infimum: it is realised.  Either

-- 4.  What the strengthening costs and buys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Cost: one datatype and four short inductions, none of which needed a new
-- idea -- every case is the same `⊓-split` case split `Γ↝-sound` already
-- performed.  That is the point.  The original proof was already this
-- strong; only its type was weak, and a weak type on a strong proof is the
-- exact failure mode the repository protocol is written against, one level
-- up from a measured constant standing in for a derived one.
--
-- Buys: `Γ↝-sound-member` is falsifiable by an implementation that returns
-- a neighbour it did not look at, and `Γ↝-optimal` is falsifiable by one
-- that stops early.  `Γ↝-sound` alone was falsifiable by neither.

-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical **v0.7** (/tmp/cubical), --cubical --safe,
-- 2026-08-15.  No postulates, no holes.  NOT verified against the pin in
-- formal/cubical/BUILD.md (Agda 2.8.0, cubical v0.9), nor against the v0.5

-- this repository at once and this file has only seen one of them.
