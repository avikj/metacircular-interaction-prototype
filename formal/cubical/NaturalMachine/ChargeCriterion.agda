-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what

-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The

-- NaturalMachine.ChargeCriterion
--
-- W2 of `TARGET.md`: the parity barrier as a DECIDABLE TEST on a method,
-- rather than as a caution about methods.
--
-- `ParitySeparator` proved one direction — a parity-neutral observer
-- cannot separate σ from its gauge flip, whatever post-processing it
-- applies.  That alone is a no-go, and a no-go with only one direction is
-- the kind of statement that lets a hopeful reader believe their favourite
-- method is the exception.  This module proves the converse, which is what
-- makes it a criterion:
--
--   **A query set admits a separating decision procedure if and only if it
--     contains a query of odd Ω.**
--
-- Both directions, exactly, with the separating procedure CONSTRUCTED in
-- the "if" direction rather than asserted to exist.  So the test is:
--
--     look at what your method reads.  If every argument it ever evaluates
--     the multiplicative function at has even Ω, your method is provably
--     parity-blind — not "has not yet succeeded", but cannot.  If some
--     argument has odd Ω, a separator exists and the barrier says nothing
--     about you.
--
-- WHY THE CONVERSE IS THE CONTENT.  `GAUGE.md` §F.4 closes with
-- "formalizing which probes carry charge is the continuation of this
-- line."  A one-directional no-go formalizes which probes DON'T.  The
-- converse is what turns the classification into a decision, and it is
-- also what stops the criterion from being vacuous: without it, "neutral
-- ⇒ blind" would be consistent with everything being blind.
--
-- WHAT IT IS NOT.  This is a criterion on the QUERY SET, not on the
-- post-processing, and that asymmetry is the theorem, not a limitation:
-- charge lives in what a method reads, and no amount of computation on
-- neutral readings manufactures it.  A method reading odd-Ω arguments is
-- *permitted* by this criterion, not blessed by it — Friedlander–Iwaniec's
-- bilinear axiom is what actually has to be supplied, and this test only
-- says where to look for it.
--
-- Contents (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   HasOdd                     the query set contains an odd-Ω argument
--   Separates                  a decision procedure that accepts the
--                              all-plus assignment and rejects its flip
--   neutral⇒no-separator       ⇐, from `ParitySeparator.no-decision`

-- §1  The reference pair.
--
-- It is enough to test one adversarial pair: the all-plus assignment and

-- criterion below quantifies over query sets and not over σ.

-- §2  The two sides of the criterion.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The query set contains an argument of odd Ω.
-- Defined by recursion on the list rather than as an indexed family, so
-- that no clause below has to match on a constructor of a list-indexed
-- type — Cubical Agda would accept such a match but warn that the
-- function fails to compute under transport, and a criterion that does
-- not compute is not a test.

-- §4  ⇒  One odd query suffices, and the separator is constructed.
--
-- Read the answer to the odd query and return it.  On σ₊ every value is
-- +1 (`val-σ₊`); on the flip the value at an odd-Ω argument is −1
-- (`val-σ₋`).  The induction is over the position of the odd query, and
-- the procedure it builds is "drop the first k answers, then look" — the
-- simplest possible probe, which is the point: nothing clever is needed
-- once the query carries charge.
