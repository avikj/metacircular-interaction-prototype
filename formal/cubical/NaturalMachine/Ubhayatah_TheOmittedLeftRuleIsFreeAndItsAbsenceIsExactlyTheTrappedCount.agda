-- Ubhayataḥ — from both sides.
--
-- TERM.  उभयतः, on both sides / in both directions.  An ordinary adverb,
-- chosen here; no source is claimed and nothing below is anyone's theorem.
--
-- THE OMISSION.  `RewriteCertificate.Step` lifts a successor out of the
-- RIGHT operand:
--
--     add-suc : Step (add x (suc y)) (suc (add x y))
--
-- and has no rule doing the same on the left.  `Baddha_…` proved what that
-- costs: a successor in a left operand whose sibling carries a variable can
-- never reach the front, and the count of such successors is conserved by
-- every rule.  `Visranti_…` then showed the same fact operationally — `nf`
-- inspects its RIGHT argument and never its left, so a left-trapped
-- successor is never examined.
--
-- THE FIRST THING TO NOTICE IS ABOUT THE KERNEL'S OWN DESIGN, and it is
-- visible only once both rules are written down.  The omitted rule is FREE:
--
--     add-suc-left-sound : eval (add (suc x) y) ρ ≡ eval (suc (add x y)) ρ
--     add-suc-left-sound = refl
--
-- because ℕ's addition recurses on its LEFT argument, so `suc a + b`
-- reduces to `suc (a + b)` definitionally.  The rule the kernel DID include
-- is the expensive one: `add-suc`'s soundness is discharged by `+-suc`, a
-- library lemma, and appears in `step-sound` as the only clause that needs
-- one.  So the calculus omitted the free rule and kept the costly one, and
-- the omission is what makes it sequential.  No claim that this was
-- deliberate; the observation is that the price was paid on the wrong side.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.
--
--   §2  the omitted rule is sound, by `refl`;
--   §3  in the extended calculus the pair `Baddha_…` separated is joined,
--       in ONE step: `add (suc var) yvar → suc (add var yvar)`;
--   §4  so `Baddha_…`'s trapped count is NOT conserved by the extension —
--       exhibited, 1 against 0 — which is the precise sense in which the
--       extension buys something.  What it buys is exactly what that count
--       measured, and nothing else was measuring it.
--
-- THE READING THIS EXISTS FOR.  A rule set that inspects one operand and
-- never the other is a SEQUENTIAL one, in the sense the semantics-of-
-- programs literature made exact: Kahn–Plotkin's sequentiality index and
-- Berry–Curien's sequential algorithms turn on which argument a computation
-- must demand first, and Colson's theorems on primitive recursive
-- algorithms turn on their being unable to release the argument they
-- fixated on.  `Step` is right-obstinate in that sense, and `Baddha_…`'s
-- number is the cost of the obstinacy, counted.  Adding the left rule makes
-- the operator examinable from either side — the miniature of what
-- Brookes–Geva's parallel `query` does to `valof` — and the gain over the
-- sequential rule set is measured by a quantity that was already a theorem
-- before anyone asked the question.
--
-- Named as the frame this speaks to.  Nothing below is a theorem of any of
-- those authors, no concrete data structure appears, and no claim is made
-- that this kernel is an instance of their definitions — only that the
-- distinction they drew is the one the omitted rule turns on.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  Not that the extended calculus is confluent,
-- terminating, or has normal forms — `add (suc x) (suc y)` now has two
-- redexes at one position, so `Visranti_…`'s orthogonality argument does
-- NOT survive and would have to be redone by joining the critical pair.
-- Not that (word, constant) becomes a complete invariant for the extended
-- system; that is now the open question and it is not answered here.  Not
-- that the extension is an improvement — `Visranti_…` gets a decision
-- procedure out of the omission, which is a real thing to lose.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
