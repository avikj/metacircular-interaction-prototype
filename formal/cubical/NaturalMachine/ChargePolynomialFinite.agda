-- SOURCE NOTE.  `notes/CHEN_PRIMITIVE_BOUNDARY_AND_CHARGE_POLYNOMIAL.md`
-- (build worker, 2026-08-16), Theorem A §1.1 with the exact instance
-- tables of §1.5 and the verification inventory of §5; Theorem B §2.1
-- with the exhaustive three-case table of §2.2 and the SCOPE FENCE of
-- §2.4.1.  Owner provenance: D0026 §5.5 (divisor-lattice characteristic
-- polynomial) and §5.9 (Chen-envelope prime projector), i.e.
-- `collab/upstream/raw/D0026-owner-egb-core-transmission-v2-2026-08-16.md`,
-- as re-derived and disagreement-reported in the note.  The note's own
-- §5 says: "Both theorems are ideal `refl`-certificate material (finite
-- tables + one general lemma each) per the Q3 obligation; the Agda
-- landing is left to a toolchain-bearing session".  This file is that
-- landing, minus the toolchain.
--
-- WHY THIS ROUTE AND NOT A VOCABULARY EXTENSION.
-- `machine/patches/S4-certificate-vocabulary.md` §3.4 is a FINDING that
-- redirects queue Q3: Ω, ω, μ² are *not* a vocabulary problem for the
-- Natural Machine.  Ω(n) = 1 + Ω(n / lpf(n)) has an argument that is not
-- a subterm of the left-hand side, so LPO cannot orient it at all
-- (`orient` returns `Nothing`), the bounded BFS has no structural
-- descent to follow, and adding `Omega` as a `Tm` constructor buys
-- nothing because no `Step` could ever fire on it.  S4 §3.4's
-- recommendation is option (ii): serve the D0026 §5 consumers by FINITE
-- INSTANCES checked by exhaustive `refl`, which `CLAUDE.md` rates as
-- proof outright ("a finite exhaustive verification ... produces
-- mathematical objects, not measurements").  That is what is below.
-- Nothing here extends the machine's certificate language and nothing
-- here should be read as doing so.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE ENCODING CHOICE, AND ITS COST — read this before the code
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- S4 §3.4 rules out a general recursive Ω/ω/μ² *as machine vocabulary*.
-- Independently, a general recursive definition in Agda would have to be
-- either fuel-bounded (and then its correctness is a separate theorem) or
-- well-founded on a non-structural measure (and then it is a different
-- project).  The honest encoding for a finite certificate is therefore:
--
--     A NUMBER IS PRESENTED BY ITS FACTORIZATION TABLE.
--
--     Fact = List (ℕ × ℕ), where the entry `(p , e)` denotes the prime
--     power p^(1+e).  Storing the exponent MINUS ONE makes positivity
--     structural rather than a side condition, which is what lets §6's
--     classification lemma be a plain induction on the list.
--
-- On that presentation Ω, ω and μ² are *not* recursions on factorization
-- at all — they are a fold, a length, and a flat test:
--
--     Ω f = Σ exponents,   ω f = length f,   μ² f = [all exponents = 1].
--
-- THE COST, stated plainly.  The table is an INPUT.  Writing
-- `f360 = (2 , 2) ∷ (3 , 1) ∷ (5 , 0) ∷ []` asserts that 360 factors as
-- 2³·3²·5, and a reader must not be asked to take that on trust.  §3
-- therefore discharges the assertion four ways, all by kernel reduction:
--
--   (i)   `value f360 ≡ 360`         — the table multiplies out (refl);
--   (ii)  every base is prime        — exhaustive trial division (refl);
--   (iii) the bases are distinct     — (refl);
--   (iv)  Ω agrees with an INDEPENDENT trial-division Ω, imported from
--         `NaturalMachine.SieveFiber`, on every divisor of the table.
--
-- What (i)–(iv) do NOT give is that the table is *the* factorization:
-- that step is unique factorization, which is not proved here and not
-- available in the imported library at the shape needed.  So the precise
-- reading of everything below is: **these are theorems about
-- factorization tables, together with a four-way check that the three
-- tables used are correct tables for 12, 30 and 360.**  Under unique
-- factorization — and only under it — they are the note's theorems at
-- those n.  This is the single unformalized bridge in the module and it
-- is named again in the rigor boundary at the end of this header.
--
-- ℕ VERSUS ℤ.  Ω, ω, μ², `value` and every exhaustion flag live in ℕ.
-- The charge polynomial does not: μ takes the value −1, κ_r(30) = −1,
-- and the Chen functional evaluates to −1 outside the envelope, which is
-- precisely the content of §2.4.1's failure table.  So Φ, κ and `chen`
-- are ℤ-valued, over `Cubical.Data.Int`.  Only `ℤ`, `pos`, `negsuc`,
-- `_+_` and `_·_` are imported from it; negation and subtraction are
-- defined here (`negℤ`, `_∸ℤ_`) so that the module depends on as little
-- library naming as possible and so that every closed term visibly
-- reduces.

--                           list: Ω f = 1 forces f = [(p,1)], and
--                           Ω f = 2 forces f = [(p,2)] or [(p,1),(q,1)].
--                           `chen-envelope` then holds for every f in

--                           theorem".  So the failure table is proved,
--                           not written: N = 1 gives +2, p²q gives −1,
--                           pqr gives −1 (all three general in the
--                           primes), each with an explicit refutation of

--                           p^(3+k) gives 0 = the indicator, flagged as

--                           The two negative rows are then re-certified

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PRIOR ART IN THIS REPOSITORY — searched before writing, per CLAUDE.md
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   `NaturalMachine.SieveFiber` — HAS a computable Ω already, by
--     fuel-bounded trial division over ℕ, together with the
--     `allOf`/`allOf-sound` exhaustion idiom (itself credited there to
--     `PMNoSection`).  It is REUSED here, not re-derived: §3's check
--     (iv) is exactly that import, and it is what makes the factorization
--     tables checked rather than asserted.  SieveFiber's own domain is
--     [1,30] at the √X horizon; it computes no ω, no μ, no divisor sum
--     and no characteristic polynomial, so nothing below duplicates it.
--   `NaturalMachine.ChargeGradedPeeling` — Ω as a dependent index on the
--     X = 30 domain, with `peelDrops : Ω(peel n) + 1 = Ω(n)`.  That is
--     the *grading* lane; it consumes SieveFiber's Ω for the same reason
--     this module does.  Disjoint content.
--   `NaturalMachine.ChargeCriterion` — the parity barrier as a decidable
--     test on odd-Ω queries.  Uses Ω abstractly, over an axiomatized
--     `Number`; proves nothing about divisor sums.  Disjoint.
--   `NaturalMachine.ChenTwoChargeProjector` — despite the name, this is
--     support geometry: `Charge = {one, two}`, commuting projections, and
--     a countermodel showing two cofinal faces need not meet.  It states
--     explicitly that it "proves no Chen, twin-prime, or Goldbach
--     theorem".  The present module is the arithmetic content the name
--     suggests and that module deliberately does not carry: μ² − (ω−1).
--     They are complementary and neither subsumes the other.
--   `NaturalMachine.ChargeGrading` — Ω as the ℕ-grading in the abstract
--     (Delta 15 §§15.6–15.7).  Disjoint.
--   `notes/DIVISOR_LATTICE_WITNESS_FRONTIER.md` — the divisor lattice as
--     a lens poset, with ω(N) counting the prime frontier.  Same lattice,
--     different functional (minimal sufficient charts, not μ * t^Ω).  It
--     is the closest prior art in the corpus and it does not overlap.
--   `machine/patches/S4-certificate-vocabulary.md` §3.4 — the finding
--     that redirected this task; quoted above.
--
--   Nothing found in `formal/cubical/` defines ω, μ, μ², a Möbius
--   divisor sum, or Rota's characteristic polynomial.  Those are new
--   here.  Ω is NOT new here and is not re-implemented as a recursion:
--   the module's Ω is a fold over a table, and it is checked against
--   SieveFiber's.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- RIGOR BOUNDARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   CERTIFIED, instance-wise, at exactly these n and nowhere else:
--     Theorem A (identity + evaluation) at n = 12, 30, 360;
--       t = 2 and 3 for n = 12 and n = 30, and t = 2, 3, 5 for n = 360.
--       These are precisely the entries the source note tabulates.
--     coefficient vectors κ at n = 12, 30, 360.
--     partition of unity at (n , t) = (360 , 2) and (12 , 3), and
--       nowhere else.
--
--   CERTIFIED, generally, but INSIDE THE ENCODING:
--     the envelope classification (§6) and hence Theorem B for every
--       factorization table with 1 ≤ Ω ≤ 2 — this quantifies over all
--       primes, not over a sample;
--     the failure rows of §2.4.1 for every p, q, r and every exponent
--       3 + k.
--
--   NOT CLAIMED, anywhere:
--     * Theorem A for general n.  Multiplicativity of μ * t^Ω and the
--       telescoping prime-power computation are the note's §1.2 proof
--       and are NOT formalized here; three instances are three instances.
--     * unique factorization.  See "THE COST" above: the bridge from a
--       table to the integer it names is checked four ways and is still
--       a bridge.
--     * any analytic content.  §2.4.3 of the note is emphatic that the
--       anti-saturation estimate is missing and that "any downstream text
--       citing this note as evidence toward twin primes or Goldbach is
--       misciting it".  That applies verbatim to this module.  Δ, the
--       primitive boundary functional of §2.3, and Theorems B3/B4 are
--       DELIBERATELY ABSENT: they quantify over primes in a window, which
--       is not refl material and would need a prime enumeration this
--       module does not have.
--     * anything about the machine's certificate language.  See S4 §3.4.
--
--   TYPECHECKING COST, declared because it is the one place this module
--   could be expensive: §4's Φ₃₆₀(5) forces the kernel to evaluate
--   5^6 = 15625 and a 24-term ℤ sum in unary-successor Int arithmetic,
--   twice (raw and closed).  Everything else is small.  If the kernel
--   session finds this line slow, it is that line; it is kept because
--   8000 is one of the note's own checksums.
