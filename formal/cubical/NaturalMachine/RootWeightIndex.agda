-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:

-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The

--
-- Delta 17 T17.24, corrected, and the correction turns out to be the
-- corpus's parity obstruction.
--
-- WHAT T17.24 SAYS: "For the diagonal torus action on (G_m)^k, character
-- lattice modulo diagonal character is the A_{k−1} root lattice."
--
-- WHAT IS TRUE: ℤ^k / ℤ·(1,…,1) is the A_{k−1} **weight** lattice P.
-- The **root** lattice Q is the sublattice {x : Σxᵢ = 0} ⊂ ℤ^k, which is
-- a different object: Q injects into P (they meet ℤδ only at 0) with
--
--     P / Q  ≅  ℤ/k.
--
-- Proof, for the record and because it is three lines: the coordinate sum
-- σ : ℤ^k → ℤ is surjective with kernel exactly Q, and σ(δ) = k, so
-- ℤ^k/(Q + ℤδ) ≅ ℤ/kℤ.  Root and weight lattice differ by exactly the
-- centre of SL_k, which is standard; T17.24 states the quotient and names
-- the sublattice.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT PEDANTRY.  T17.24 is load-bearing: it is cited by
-- `SINGULAR_SERIES_LOCAL_FACTOR_IS_A_ROOT_SUBSYSTEM_RANK.md`, whose
-- 108,596-instance exact verification of ν_p(H) = k − rank Φ_p(H) is a
-- statement about the ROOT system.  A note resting on a lattice named
-- wrongly is a note whose ranks might be off by the index.  (They are
-- not — rank is insensitive to the P/Q distinction — but that is a fact
-- to check, not to assume, and it is checked by the fact that the
-- singular-series note uses rank alone.)
--
-- AND THE PAYOFF.  At k = 2 the index is ℤ/2, and that ℤ/2 is not a new
-- object: it is `PairCoordinates.sumIsDouble`, the parity constraint on
-- Delta 17's cone, which `ConeImage.cone-image` proved is exactly the
-- image condition of the pair map.  So the cone's parity constraint IS
-- the root-versus-weight index of A_1.  Three items in the Delta ledger
-- — T17.13's congruence, T17.24's lattice, and T22.5's discriminant —
-- are one index computation.

--
-- Everything is over an ARBITRARY commutative ring, so "the index is 2"
-- is stated in the form that survives base change: the image of the root
-- lattice is the doubles.  Over ℤ the doubles have index 2 and that final
-- step is the ℤ-specific parity fact, already checked elsewhere in this
-- development rather than re-derived here.
--
-- NOT claimed: novelty.  P/Q ≅ ℤ/k for A_{k−1} is in every Lie theory
-- text.  What is contributed is the correction to T17.24 as supplied, and
-- the identification of the k = 2 index with the corpus's own parity
