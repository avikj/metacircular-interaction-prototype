-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:

-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what

-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The

-- NaturalMachine.FiniteWorldMaximizer
--
-- The general finite no-go of `notes/ENCOUNTERED_WORLDS.md` §2 WITH ITS
-- NONVANISHING HYPOTHESIS MADE PART OF THE TYPE.
--
-- SOURCE STATEMENT (`notes/ENCOUNTERED_WORLDS.md:62`, verbatim):
--
--   **Theorem.** For every integral polynomial `f`, every finite `E`
--   with `f != 0` on `E` has a point that fails to transport: any point
--   maximizing `v_p(f)`.
--
-- The audit `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_5.md` §C1 records that the summary
-- message `workers/20260812T090934.276887Z--claude_ananta--0005.md` §3
-- restates it as "For **every** integral polynomial, every finite `E`
-- has a point that cannot transport — any maximizer of `v_p(f)`",
-- dropping the clause "with `f != 0` on `E`".  Like §C2 (instrumented
-- by `LineWorldTransport` / `Control/QuantifierDrop`) the drop has no
-- lexical signature: the shortened sentence contains no wrong word,
-- only a missing clause.
--
-- WHAT KIND OF DEFECT THIS IS — stated because it differs from C2's and
-- the difference bounds what the instrument shows.  C2's dropped
-- hypothesis leaves a sentence that is FALSE.  C1's leaves one the
-- audit calls "not even well formed": with `f ≡ 0` on `E` every point
-- has `v_p(f) = ∞`, so "any maximizer of `v_p(f)`" — the message's
-- entire proof — denotes nothing.  Ill-formedness is not directly a
-- type-checkable falsehood, so it is TRANSLATED here, by one modelling
-- decision that must be stated openly: `MaxAt W m` requires the
-- maximizer `m` to be a point where the observable does not vanish
-- (`IsFin (W m)`), which is what "the point maximizing `v_p(f)`" has to
-- mean if it means anything.  Under that reading the dropped-clause
-- statement becomes false — `vanishing-world` has no maximizer at all —
-- and `dropped-hypothesis-false` proves it.  A reader who rejects that
-- reading is left with the weaker but still true claim that the term
-- cannot be built; the control below exhibits both, since Agda's error
-- is a MISSING-ARGUMENT error naming the clause.
--
-- THIS IS A MODEL, NOT THE FULL SETTING.  Formalized here is the
-- smallest world that carries the distinction:
--
--   * `E` is a two-point set `Pt`; a world is a valuation
--     `W : Pt → Val` with `Val = fin ℕ ⊎ ∞`, where `∞` is `v_p(0)`,
--     the valuation at a point where `f` vanishes;
--   * `NonVanishing W` is the note's clause "`f != 0` on `E`", i.e.
--     every point has finite valuation;
--   * `maximizer` produces, from a world AND that certificate, a point
--     together with a proof that no point of `E` exceeds it — the
--     "point maximizing `v_p(f)`" the theorem's proof names.
--
-- Everything below is a closed computation or a two-case induction on
-- ℕ; there is no fitting and no sampling (CLAUDE.md).  What the model
-- does NOT contain: the transport criterion itself, the Lemma
-- (`y ≡ x mod p^e ⇒ f(y) ≡ f(x) mod p^e`), or any statement about
-- infinite `E`.  It contains exactly the step the summary broke — that
-- the maximizer exists — and nothing else.
--
-- HEADLINE TERMS
