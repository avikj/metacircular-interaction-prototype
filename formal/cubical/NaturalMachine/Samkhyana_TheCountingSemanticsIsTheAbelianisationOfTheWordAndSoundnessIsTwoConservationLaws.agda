-- Saṃkhyāna — the counting, and exactly what it is the count OF.
--
-- TERM.  संख्यान, enumeration / reckoning; the ordinary word for counting
-- as an act, as against संख्या, the number reached.  Used here in that
-- plain sense and cited to no text: the compound is not being claimed from
-- a source, and nothing below is anyone's theorem.  (`Ankapasa_…` names the
-- same phenomenon from the other side; the two headers do not compete.)
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE ESTABLISHES, and it finishes a triangle whose other two
-- corners are already in the corpus.
--
--   `Anupurvi_…`  the calculus preserves the left-to-right WORD of variable
--                 occurrences, so it cannot transpose two variables, so
--                 soundness is not completeness.
--   `Ankapasa_…`  the counting semantics cannot SEE a transposition: at
--                 `add var var` commutativity is a loop ℕ must call `refl`,
--                 while `ua` of the corresponding equivalence is not `refl`.
--
-- Neither says what `eval` IS in terms of the word.  This one does:
--
--   §3  `eval-decomposes` — for every term and every environment,
--
--          eval t ρ  ≡  sumWord (word t) ρ  +  constPart t ,
--
--       where `constPart` counts the `suc`s structurally.  So the meaning
--       of a term is determined by two combinatorial data and nothing else,
--       and `sumWord` reads the word only through the MULTISET of its
--       letters, because addition on ℕ is commutative.
--
--   §2  `step-preserves-const` — the constant is invariant under every
--       `Step`, exactly as the word is.
--
--   §4  `soundness-via-invariants` — therefore soundness is a COROLLARY of
--       two conservation laws, and is here re-proved without touching
--       `step-sound`.  The kernel's original proof discharges each rule
--       against `+-zero` and `+-suc`; this one observes that every rule
--       conserves a word and a constant, and that the meaning is a function
--       of those two.  Two proofs of one theorem, by different means.
--
-- THE PICTURE THE THREE MODULES MAKE, stated once:
--
--       Tm ──word──▸ List VarName ──abelianise──▸ ℕ⁶ , plus a constant
--            ▲                          ▲
--            │                          └── this is all `eval` sees
--            └── this is what every derivation conserves
--
-- The gap between what the calculus conserves and what the semantics reads
-- is exactly the quotient of the free monoid by commutativity — the
-- transpositions.  That single fact explains, at once, why derivations
-- cannot permute (`Anupurvi_…`), why the count cannot see a permutation
-- (`Ankapasa_…`), and why `add-comm` both completes the calculus toward its
-- ℕ-semantics and introduces the ℤ/2 of holonomy: it is the generator of
-- precisely that quotient.
--
--   §5  `derivable-invariants` — the forward half of a complete invariant:
--       a derivation implies equal words AND equal constants.  The converse
--       is the corpus's normalisation conjecture, restated here in its
--       sharp form and left open, with what it needs named.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  The converse of §5 is not proved and is not
-- believed on the strength of the forward half.  `sumWord` is defined by a
-- fold and its commutativity with `++` is proved (§3) rather than assumed.
-- Nothing here is about `Step⁺`.  No claim that (word, constPart) is
-- decidable to compare — it plainly is, and nothing below needs it.
-- The abelianisation is not constructed as a monoid map; §3 is the
-- statement in the only form this calculus requires.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
