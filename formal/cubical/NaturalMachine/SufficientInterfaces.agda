-- Sufficient Interfaces for Relational Computation — Delta 01, checked.
-- (collab/upstream/library/raw/SUFFICIENT_INTERFACES_DELTA_01_2026-08-13.md)
--
-- WHY THIS ONE.  collab/upstream/WHAT_IS_BUILT.md carried the row
--
--     | Sufficient interfaces Δ01–03 (Suff, κ₀, τ*, C∞) | **nothing** |
--
-- and Δ01 is the member of that group whose content is finite, exact, and
-- decidable end to end — it needs no analytic input and no new
-- mathematics to enter the substrate.  It is also the document that
-- states, as a theorem, the failure mode this collaboration keeps
-- committing:
--
--   §15: "lossy context compression is safe only if every collapsed state
--    shares a valid next action.  If not, the compressor has erased a
--    decision-relevant distinction."
--
-- and then §3 exhibits the minimal witness that this can fail even when
-- every part looks fine — two individually sufficient interfaces whose
-- join is not sufficient.  Delta 01 calls that "an exact finite gluing
-- obstruction", and it is the finite shadow of the question the owner
-- asks in three separate places (U0006 §3; Delta 15 §§15.11–15.12,
-- Programs 15.47–15.49; Delta 17 §17.21): build a cover, compute the
-- transition data, find the obstruction to gluing local sections.  Here
-- the cover is a partition, the local sections are blockwise witnesses,
-- and the obstruction is exhibited rather than conjectured.
--
-- Contents (all proved, no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   Sufficient, Realization    §0/§1: a common witness per block; a
--                              deterministic selector
--   suff→real, real→suff       T1, the selector criterion, both ways
--   IsSimplex, simplex-down    T12: N_R is a simplicial complex
--   suff→simplices             T13: sufficiency is blockwise simplexhood
--   simplices→suff             …and conversely, by construction
--   refine-sufficient          T4: Suff(R) is downward closed — a finer
--                              interface inherits every witness

--   join-fails                 P6: THE witness.  π, σ sufficient, π∨σ not
--   materialization-gap        T8/§5: the composite is realizable from
--                              one block while the intermediate is not —
--                              an architectural boundary forcing a
--                              distinction the end task does not need
--   unsafe-compression         §15/§16 read back: a compressor whose
--                              collapsed class admits no common action
--
-- NOT claimed: novelty, and none of the NP-hardness.  T3 identifies κ₀
-- with a set-cover number and Cor 3.1 concludes NP-hardness; that is a
-- statement about explicitly represented finite relations and is not
-- formalized here.  What is formalized is every statement of Δ01 that is
-- a theorem about the relation itself rather than about the cost of
-- computing with it.

-- §1  The primitive, and Theorem 1
--
-- Δ01 §0: a partition π of A is R-sufficient iff every block E has a
-- common valid output, ⋂_{a∈E} R(a) ≠ ∅.
--
-- A partition is presented by its quotient map q : A → Q; the block over
-- c is the fibre {a : q a ≡ c}.  This is the presentation the rest of the
-- development needs, because refinement (§3) is then just a factorisation
-- of q, and it is faithful: any partition is the kernel of its own
-- quotient map.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

module _ {A : Type ℓA} {B : Type ℓB} {Q : Type ℓQ}

  -- Every fibre of q has a witness valid for all of its members.
  Sufficient : (A → Q) → Type (ℓ-max ℓA (ℓ-max ℓB (ℓ-max ℓQ ℓR)))
  Sufficient q = (c : Q) → Σ[ b ∈ B ] ((a : A) → q a ≡ c → R a b)

  Realization q = Σ[ s ∈ (Q → B) ] ((a : A) → R a (s (q a)))

  -- T1, (i) ⇒ (ii).  The selector is the choice of witness at each block.
  -- Constructively this is the type-theoretic axiom of choice — a Π of Σ
  -- becoming a Σ of Π — which is exactly what Δ01's "choose s(E) from the
  -- common intersection" is, and it is available here without assumption.
  suff→real : (q : A → Q) → Sufficient q → Realization q
  suff→real q σ = (λ c → fst (σ c)) , λ a → snd (σ (q a)) a refl

-- §2  Theorems 12 and 13: the nerve
--
-- Δ01 §10: N_R = {S ⊆ A : ⋂_{a∈S} R(a) ≠ ∅} is an abstract simplicial
-- complex, and π is sufficient iff every block of π is a simplex.
--
-- Note what T2 becomes here.  Δ01 T2 says S is an admissible block iff
-- S ⊆ E_b for some b, where E_b = {a : b ∈ R(a)}.  Since E_b is literally
-- `λ a → R a b`, the containment S ⊆ E_b *is* `(a : A) → S a → R a b`, so
-- T2 is the definition of `IsSimplex` read twice.  Recording that rather

-- §3  Theorem 4: Suff(R) is an order ideal
--
-- Δ01 §3: if π is sufficient and ρ ≤ π (ρ finer), then ρ is sufficient —

--
-- "ρ finer than π" is presented as a factorisation: π's quotient map
-- factors through ρ's.  That is the same relation, and it makes the proof
-- the transport it should be.

-- §5  Proposition 6 — the exact finite gluing obstruction
--
-- Δ01 §3:
--
--     A = {1,2,3}, B = {x,y}, R(1)={x}, R(2)={x,y}, R(3)={y}.
--     π = {{1,2},{3}} and σ = {{1},{2,3}} are sufficient,
--     but π ∨ σ = {{1,2,3}} is not.
--
--     "locally valid coarse-grainings can glue transitively into a
--      globally invalid class.  This is an exact finite gluing
--      obstruction; no cohomological claim is made yet."
--
-- Therefore Suff(R) is a meet-semilattice and an order ideal, and NOT a
-- sublattice.  §3's downward closure and this failure of upward closure
-- are the two halves of that.
--
-- This is the smallest object in the corpus that does what the owner's
-- descent programme asks for: local sections exist on each piece of a
-- cover, and no global section exists.  Point 2 has a witness; the
-- element 2 is the overlap, valid under both x and y, and it is exactly
-- the freedom at the overlap that lets the two blocks be glued into an
-- invalid one.

-- §7  Δ01 §§11 and 15–16, read back at this collaboration
--
-- Δ01 T11 defines an information edge exactly: given a quotient q, there
-- is no task-relative obstruction precisely when ker(q) ∈ Suff(R).  §15
-- applies it to agents: with Ω the possible research states, q a context
-- compressor, and R(ω) the actions valid in ω, the compressor is safe for
-- action selection iff every collapsed class shares a valid action.
--
-- `Sufficient` above IS that predicate, so the statement needs no new
-- definition — only the naming, and the negative witness, which §5
-- already supplies.  An unsafe compressor is a `Sufficient` that fails,
-- and `join-fails` is the smallest one: two summaries, each individually
-- adequate for its own purpose, merged into a view from which no valid
-- next action is available at all.
--
-- The moral Δ01 draws is that this is not a limitation of language
-- models: it is set cover (T3), and it is NP-hard before any model enters
-- the picture.
