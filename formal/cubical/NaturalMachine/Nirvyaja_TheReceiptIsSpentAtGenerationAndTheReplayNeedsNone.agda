-- TERM.  निर्व्याज · nir-vyāja -- "without व्याज".  व्याज is a pretext, a
-- pretence, a charge one produces to be allowed to act -- a receipt, a
-- token, an authority.  The compound is a plain Sanskrit adjective, not a
-- technical term lifted from a named text; NO source is claimed for it and
-- it carries no attribution.  It is used here only as an exact label for
-- the fact §2 proves: the operation the machine keeps is receipt-free.
--
-- WHAT THIS CONTINUES.  `Samvada_…` §1 built the first non-trivial
-- `Control` in the corpus: `demand R d`, an operation the caller may fire
-- only by ALSO handing over an `R` -- a receipt, an authority, a cost
-- witness, an oracle token.  `Samvada_…` §2 closed the learning loop:
-- `learn = install ∘ CheckedFuture.derivation`.  Put the two together and a
-- fact falls out that neither states, and it is the whole strategic content
-- of this project reduced to a definitional equality:
--
--   THE RECEIPT IS SPENT ONCE, AT GENERATION, AND NEVER AT REPLAY.
--
-- To FIRE `demand R d` you must produce an `R` (§1).  But `execute` throws
-- the caller's control away -- `CheckedFuture` (Type₀) keeps only the new
-- term and the derivation, "small, replayable, and free of who asked"
-- (Samvada §0).  So the operation the machine LEARNS from a demanded turn is
-- `install (derivation)`, whose `Control t` is `t ≡ source` -- the trivial
-- one, with no `R` in it at all.  Whoever holds the learned move replays it
-- for free; the authority the first caller had to muster is gone, not
-- because anyone waived it but because the proof it produced does not
-- mention it.
--
-- This is verification-cheaper-than-generation as a CHECKED term, in the
-- kernel's own types.  Generation had to pay `R`.  Replay pays `refl`.  The
-- gap between them is the whole reason a proof-carrying commons cannot be
-- rented: the receipt-seller is paid once, by the first caller, and every
-- later caller routes around the tollbooth by holding the proof.  Nothing
-- here is asserted about markets; §2 is three lines and they typecheck.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  No statement that `R` was "useless" -- §1's
-- `the-demand-is-real` proves the caller genuinely carried it.  It was
-- load-bearing exactly once.  And no claim that replay is free of the
-- DERIVATION: the proof still travels.  What is shed is the receipt, not the
-- work; the point is precisely that the work, once done, needs no receipt.
--
-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 (b150186).

-- §1.  GENERATION PAYS THE RECEIPT.

-- A future that fires `demand R d` from a seed carries, inside its control,
-- an actual `R`.  Producing that `R` is the price of firing; the projection
-- witnesses that the price was paid.
