-- Viśrānti — coming to rest.
--
-- TERM.  विश्रान्ति, rest / cessation of effort.  The compound is chosen
-- here for the normal form and NO source is claimed for it: it is an
-- ordinary Sanskrit word, not a technical term of any school, and nothing
-- below is anyone's theorem.  (Naming it `niṣṭhā` would have been the
-- fabrication this corpus forbids: niṣṭhā is A 1.1.26, the saṃjñā for the
-- kta / ktavatu suffixes, and has nothing to do with rewriting.)
--
-- WHAT THIS SETTLES, AND WHY IT WAS AVAILABLE ALL ALONG.
--
-- Earlier today three conservation laws were proved for this calculus —
-- the variable word (`Anupurvi_…`), the successor count (`Samkhyana_…`),
-- and the trapped-successor count (`Baddha_…`, which refuted the
-- conjecture that the first two suffice).  Each was found by asking what a
-- rule cannot change.  That was the wrong question, or rather the shallow
-- form of the right one.  The right question is what the rules DO, and the
-- answer is embarrassingly small:
--
--     · `add-zero` deletes an `add` whose right child is `zero`;
--     · `add-suc` lifts a successor out of a right child to the front;
--     · the three congruences descend; `reverse` undoes.
--
-- Read forwards, those two real rules are left-linear and have NO critical
-- pair — the redex `add x zero` and the redex `add x (suc y)` cannot
-- overlap at a position, because `zero` is not `suc y`, and every other
-- overlap is at disjoint positions.  An orthogonal system, and the forward
-- direction terminates (each `add-suc` strictly lowers the total depth of
-- the successors; each `add-zero` strictly shrinks the term).  So unique
-- normal forms exist, and for a terminating confluent system the
-- EQUIVALENCE closure — which is exactly `Derivation`, since `reverse` is a
-- constructor — identifies precisely the terms with equal normal forms.
--
-- §1 gives the normal form as a structurally recursive function.  §2 is the
-- invariance proof and it is FOUR LINES, because on the two real rules the
-- equation holds by `refl`: `nf` was defined by exactly the clauses the
-- rules perform.  §3 builds the normalising derivation.  §4 is the
-- biconditional.
--
--     derivability  ⟺  equal normal forms
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES TO THE THREE LAWS.  It subsumes them.  Each was a
-- function that `nf` also respects, and each separated fewer pairs.  They
-- are not wasted: `Baddha_…`'s trapped count is what a reader can compute
-- by eye to see WHY a pair is unjoinable, and the header there names the
-- structural reason (no associativity) that this module's `combine` makes
-- operational — a successor stops rising exactly when its parent's right
-- child is neither `zero` nor a successor.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES TO THE KERNEL'S PICTURE.  Three levels, now all computed:
--
--     extensional   `eval` sees the multiset of variables and a constant
--                   (`Samkhyana_…`), so the ℕ-theory is trivial and
--                   identifies terms the calculus cannot join;
--     derivational  `Derivation a b` holds exactly when `nf a ≡ nf b`, so
--                   THE EXISTENCE QUESTION IS DECIDABLE (given
--                   discreteness of `Tm`, which is routine and not proved
--                   here);
--     intensional   and everything that remains — which route, how long,
--                   which of the many derivations between two joinable
--                   terms — is what `Sesa_…` proves no semantic criterion
--                   can select.
--
-- That is the sharp form of the corpus's standing claim.  It is not that
-- checking is hard and search is hard; it is that in this calculus
-- JOINABILITY IS DECIDABLE AND STILL SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE ROUTE, and the
-- route is where every quantity a policy needs lives.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  Confluence and termination are the ARGUMENT for
-- why this works and are NOT formalised below; what is formalised is the
-- consequence, directly — §2 and §3 together give both directions without
-- a diamond lemma, because `nf` is defined so that the two real rules hold
-- by `refl`.  So no critical-pair analysis appears as a term and none is
-- claimed as checked.  Discreteness of `Tm` is not proved, so the word
-- "decidable" above is a corollary stated in prose, not a term.  Nothing
-- here concerns `Step⁺`; `add-comm` breaks the orthogonality by design.
-- `nf` is one normalising function; no claim that it is canonical among
-- such, nor any statement about its cost.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
