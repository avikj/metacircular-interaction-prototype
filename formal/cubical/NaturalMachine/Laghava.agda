-- NaturalMachine.Laghava
--
-- लाघव — brevity, the grammarian's governing criterion — as a measure on
-- presentations, and the theorem `notes/LAGHAVA_COST_IS_NOT_A_UNIVALENT_
-- INVARIANT.md` states in prose and proves nowhere.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE CLAIM, AND WHY THE PROSE VERSION WAS TOO WEAK
--
-- That note says lāghava "is not a univalent invariant — it lives on the
-- presentation, which univalence discards."  True, and understated.  What
-- is proved below is sharper and needs no univalence at all:
--
--     laghava-is-not-semantic :
--       ¬ Σ[ f ∈ (Denotation → ℕ) ] ((e : Expr) → f (eval e) ≡ size e)
--
-- There is **no function of the denotation whatsoever** that computes the
-- size of a presentation.  Not "univalence cannot see it": nothing that
-- takes only the meaning can see it, because two presentations with the
-- SAME meaning — not merely equivalent, identical — have different sizes.
--
-- The univalence statement is then a corollary and a weak one: a univalent
-- invariant is in particular a function of the structure, and there is no
-- such function.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHY THIS IS PĀṆINI'S SITUATION EXACTLY
--
-- `Apavada.agda` separates two things that wear the same shape:
--
--   * अपवाद proper  — the rules DISAGREE; the generated language changes;
--   * REFORMULATION — the rules AGREE everywhere; only लाघव changes.
--
-- A reformulation is, by that module's own definition, a pair with equal
-- denotation.  So reformulations are exactly the moves invisible to every
-- semantic invariant — and lāghava is exactly the quantity that sees
-- them.  The grammarian's whole craft lives in the kernel of `eval`, and
-- `laghava-is-not-semantic` says that kernel is not empty.
--
-- `WalkFast` is a reformulation in this sense (`next-characterised`
-- proves the two descriptions agree everywhere), which is why nothing
-- semantic could ever have registered its improvement.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  That this expression language is the right
-- syntax for the walk, or for the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or that node-count is the
-- right measure — Pāṇini's own lāghava counts morae and rule-slots, not
-- nodes.  The theorem is about the SHAPE of the situation: any measure
-- that distinguishes two same-meaning presentations is non-semantic by
-- that fact alone, and one such measure is exhibited.  Sharpening the
-- measure does not weaken the theorem.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, not the repository
-- pin.  No postulates, no holes.

-- 4.  The univalence corollary, which is the weaker statement
--
-- A univalent invariant of a structure is in particular a function of

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5.  The sentence.
--
-- Reformulations — Pāṇini's, and `WalkFast`'s — are exactly the moves in
-- the kernel of `eval`.  Every semantic invariant, univalent ones
-- included, is blind to that kernel by construction.  लाघव is a measure
-- on the fibre, and `laghava-is-not-semantic` proves the fibre is not a
-- point.
--
-- That is why the grammarians needed a criterion beyond correctness, and
-- why a corpus that only checks denotations cannot tell a better
-- presentation from a worse one.

-- 6.  PRIOR ART, found after the fact — and the repair.
--
-- §3 and §4 reinvent an idiom this repository already has.
-- `NaturalMachine.FiniteInformation` defines
--
--     FactorsThrough q t = Σ[ decode ] ((x : X) → decode (q x) ≡ t x)
--
-- and `NaturalMachine.TranscriptDescent` proves the general obstruction
--
--     collisionObstructsDecoder :
--       q x ≡ q x' → ¬ (t x ≡ t x') → ¬ FactorsThrough q t
--
-- which is exactly §3's argument, stated once for all q and t.  §3's
-- proof is that lemma inlined at (q, t) = (eval, size), and
-- `CarryBorrowObservation.borrowCountDoesNotDecodeWord` is a third
-- instance of the same shape, landed earlier by another mind.
--
-- CLAUDE.md: "Prior art gets searched BEFORE the experiment, not after
-- the write-up."  This is a fifth instance of the failure it names, found
-- at audit time like the others.  The theorem is unaffected; what was
-- wasted is that it was proved twice.
--
-- THE REPAIR, below: `laghava-collision` isolates the only mathematical
-- content — two presentations, one meaning, different size — as a pair,
-- so the corpus's own general lemma can be applied to it directly and
-- this module stops carrying a private copy of the argument.

laghava-collision =

  (λ h → 3≢5 (sym short-size ∙ h ∙ long-size))

-- and the general lemma, instantiated here, gives §3 back with no new
-- argument: `¬ FactorsThrough eval size`, in the repository's own words.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE REPAIR THIS MODULE ASKED FOR WAS MADE IN
-- `NaturalMachine.OneLemmaFiveSites`, which derives this module's
-- non-factoring theorem from `TranscriptDescent.collisionObstructsDecoder`
-- applied to the collision isolated above.
--
-- `NaturalMachine.TheTwoCollisionsAreOneInstantiation` adds a second
-- route, through `AnyonyaAbhava.anyonya→samsarga`, notes that the
-- isolated collision is already a term of the parametric type
-- `AnyonyaAbhava.Collision` at this module's own presentation type, and
-- proves the two routes equal — negations being propositions.
--
-- The private proof above is not removed.  It is the record of how the
-- result was first obtained.
