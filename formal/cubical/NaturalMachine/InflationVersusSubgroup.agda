-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- Thm 3.5 of `notes/EIGHT_CLASSES_COLLAPSE_TO_FOUR_SLOTS.md` WITH ITS
-- QUALIFIER MADE PART OF THE TYPE: the enlargement it is about is
-- enlargement ALONG A QUOTIENT, and the other reading of "enlargement"
-- — a subgroup inclusion Γ ≤ G — has no map for the theorem to be
-- about.
--
-- SOURCE STATEMENT (`notes/EIGHT_CLASSES_COLLAPSE_TO_FOUR_SLOTS.md`
-- §3.5, verbatim):
--
--   *Let N ⊴ G act trivially on V, and let Γ = G/N.  Then inflation
--   inf : H¹(Γ,V) → H¹(G,V) is injective.  Hence enlarging the symmetry
--   group from Γ to G never kills a nonzero class.*
--
-- The audit `notes/FULL_READ_DRAW_5.md` §D7 records that §0's table
-- keeps the qualifier ("enlarging the symmetry group along a quotient")
-- and that §2.8, §3.5's own Reading, §4's rejection row and §5.5 all
-- drop it: "symmetry enlargement: Thm 3.5 proves this is **not a repair
-- at all**", "widening *symmetry* cannot [kill]", "*refuted, not a
-- repair*", "one of which (symmetry enlargement) is **proved** to be no
-- repair" — and §3.5 calls the flattened version "the note's principal
-- negative".  The dropped qualifier has no lexical signature: the
-- flattened sentences contain no wrong word, only a missing one.
--
-- WHAT IS AT STAKE.  For Γ ≤ G there is no canonical
-- H¹(Γ,V) → H¹(G,V) at all; the canonical map runs the other way
-- (restriction).  So the subgroup reading is not "also proved" and it
-- is not even "unproved by the same argument": there is nothing for the
-- argument to be applied to, and — as this file shows on the smallest
-- model — the transport a repair-claim would need is not merely
-- unproved but IMPOSSIBLE.
--
-- THIS IS A MODEL, NOT THE FULL SETTING.  The full setting is H¹ of an
-- arbitrary group with arbitrary coefficients.  Formalized here is the
-- smallest pair that realizes both readings at once:
--
--   * G = ℤ/4, N = {0,2} ≅ ℤ/2 ⊴ G, Γ = G/N ≅ ℤ/2, V = ℤ/2 trivial
--     action.  N is BOTH the kernel of the quotient (giving the
--     inflation reading) AND a subgroup of G (giving the subgroup
--     reading), so the two readings are compared on one and the same
--     group inclusion/projection pair.
--   * With trivial action, H¹(A,V) = Hom(A,V).  Hom(ℤ/4,ℤ/2) = {0,χ}
--     with χ = proj, and Hom(ℤ/2,ℤ/2) = {0,id}; these are enumerated as
--     `H4` and `H2`, each class carried by its realizing function
--     (`real4`, `real2`).
--   * `infl` is CERTIFIED to be precomposition with `proj`
--     (`infl-is-inflation`) and `res` is CERTIFIED to be precomposition
--     with `incl` (`res-is-restriction`), so neither is an ad-hoc table.
--     `proj` and `incl` are checked to be group homomorphisms by finite
--     exhaustion over all 16 resp. 4 pairs.  Everything below is a
--     closed computation; every proof is `refl` or a case split
--     (CLAUDE.md: exact / certified symbolic computation is proof).
--
-- SCOPE LIMIT, stated because it is real: `H4` and `H2` are DECLARED to
-- be the hom-sets, not proved exhaustive — that each listed class is a
-- homomorphism is checked (`real4-hom`, `real2-hom`), that there are no
-- others is not.  Exhaustiveness is not used by any statement below:
-- `no-section` quantifies over an ARBITRARY function `H2 → H4`, so it
-- is a statement about the model's H¹ as enumerated, and a larger
-- hom-set could only be a different model, not a hole in this one.
