-- NaturalMachine.UnfoldAlgebra
--
-- `unfold` IS A FREE-MONOID ENDOMORPHISM, AND EVERY MEASURE IN THE LANE
-- IS A WEIGHT IT ACTS ON LINEARLY.
--
-- `NaturalMachine.TermFreeMonoid` established that (Tm, plug, var) is
-- the free monoid on Shape, and collected the payoff for the lane's two
-- ADDITIVE MEASURES (`size`, `deficit V`), which it exhibited as
-- instances of one recursion scheme.  It stopped there, at the measures.
--
-- This file takes the next step, which is the one the lane was actually
-- built around: `unfold d b` — the operation the whole definitional
-- half of `Obstruction` turns on — is not a new construction either.
-- It is THE ENDOMORPHISM OF THE FREE MONOID determined by
--
--     d ↦ b,      c ↦ node c var   (c ≠ d),
--
-- i.e. an ordinary substitution.  Once that is checked (§2), three
-- things follow that were previously proved by hand, bounded rather
-- than computed, or not stated at all.
--
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED
--
-- §1  WEIGHTS.  `weight w` is the extension of `w : Shape → ℕ` along the
--     universal property, into (ℕ, +, 0).  The lane's three measures are
--     weights, on the nose:
--
--         size        ≡ weight (λ _ → 1)          `size-is-weight`
--         deficit V   ≡ weight (delta V)          `deficit-is-weight`
--         gaps s V    ≡ weight (gapAt s V)        `gaps-is-weight`
--
--     and `count d`, the number of occurrences of the head `d`, is the
--     weight of the indicator of `d`.  `weight-plug` (additivity) is
--     `TermFreeMonoid.rec-additive`, not a fourth induction.
--
-- §2  `unfold-is-rec`, `unfold-plug`
--         `unfold d b` is the free extension of the generator map, and
--         is therefore a MONOID ENDOMORPHISM:
--             unfold d b (plug t u) ≡ plug (unfold d b t) (unfold d b u).
--         Neither statement was anywhere in the lane.  `unfold-plug` is
--         `rec-additive` at M = Tm — the same theorem TermFreeMonoid
--         used for `size`, applied to the object rather than to a
--         measure of it.
--
-- §3  `weight-unfold`    THE SUBSTITUTION LAW.  For every weight w,
--
--             weight w (unfold d b t) ≡ weight (upd w d (weight w b)) t
--
--         — measuring after substituting is measuring before, against
--         the weight whose value at `d` has been replaced by the weight
--         of the body.  This is the transpose action: a substitution
--         acts on terms covariantly and on measures contravariantly, by
--         a nonnegative integer matrix which here has one nontrivial
--         column.
--
-- §4  `weight-upd`       THE EXACT SPLIT, with no truncated subtraction:
--
--             weight (upd w d v) t ≡ weight (upd w d 0) t + count d t · v.
--
-- §5  CONSEQUENCES FOR `NaturalMachine.WitnessPolicy`.
--
--     `size-unfold-exact`   size (unfold d b t)
--                             ≡ size (unfold d var t) + count d t · size b
--         — the informative policy's output exceeds the degenerate
--         policy's by EXACTLY (number of occurrences of the named head)
--         × (size of the payload), at every term.
--
--     `degenerate-exact`    size (unfold d var t) + count d t ≡ size t.
--         WitnessPolicy's `degenerate-never-grows` is the ≤ shadow of
--         this identity; `degenerate-never-grows′` re-derives it in one
--         line, and now the defect is named rather than dropped.
--
--     `policy-dominates-everywhere`, `policy-strict-everywhere`
--         WitnessPolicy's `policy-separation` compares the two policies
--         at ONE named term (`node (residual o) var`) and otherwise
--         opposes a strict growth to a uniform non-growth.  These
--         compare them AT EVERY TERM: degenerate ≤ informative always,
--         strictly whenever the named head actually occurs and the
--         payload is non-empty.
--
--     `count-off`           and the growth is localised exactly where
--         WitnessPolicy said the unfolding was inert: a term base over V
--         contains no occurrence of a head absent from V, so its count
--         is 0 and the two policies agree there.  `unfold-fixes-base`
--         is the reason; this is its arithmetic shadow.
--
-- §6  THE BRIDGE.  `NaturalMachine.Obstruction`'s own disclaimer says:
--
--        "The coverage chain (T5-T10) never mentions `witness`, `body`,
--         `unfold` or T1-T2. … the definitional content of a proposal
--         and the progress made by proposing it are proved side by side
--         and never interact."
--
--     `deficit-extend-unfold` makes them interact:
--
--         Over V b  →  deficit (d ∷ V) t ≡ deficit V (unfold d b t).
--
--     Installing the head and unfolding it are THE SAME PROGRESS, as an
--     identity of natural numbers, for any legal body.  The measure that
--     drives `GenerativeLoop`'s termination is therefore not indifferent
--     to the definitional half after all; it is the same number counted
--     twice.
--
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * NOT claimed as new: the deficit half of §6's arithmetic.
--    `GenerativeLoop.deficit-split` already proves
--    `deficit V t ≡ gaps d V t + deficit (d ∷ V) t`, and
--    `gaps-is-count` below shows that when `d` is absent from V the
--    first summand IS `count d t`.  So `proposal-progress-exact` is
--    `deficit-split` in this vocabulary and is recorded here as an
--    identification, not as a discovery.  What §6 adds is the OTHER
--    side of the equation — that `deficit (d ∷ V) t` is a deficit of an
--    unfolded term — which `deficit-split` does not mention because
--    nothing in that lane mentions `unfold`.
--
--  * NOT claimed: any chain-level statement.  Every theorem here is
--    about ONE substitution.  Composing the substitutions along an
--    `ObsChain` gives a strictly triangular incidence structure (each
--    body is base over the vocabulary before its own step, so it cannot
--    mention any later residual), and that is the shape a chain-level
--    conservativity and a chain-level size bound would take; neither is
--    proved here, and the triangularity itself is not proved here.
--    WitnessPolicy's "NOT claimed: a size bound on the informative
--    loop's OUTPUT" therefore still stands.
--
--  * NOT claimed: that the informative policy is optimal, canonical, or
--    matchability-improving.  WitnessPolicy proves it is not the last
--    (`policies-agree-on-matching`) and disclaims the first two; nothing
--    here disturbs either.  §5 sharpens the SIZE separation and nothing
--    else.
--
--  * NOT claimed: that `weight` is a new idea.  It is the free monoid's
--    universal property into (ℕ, +, 0) — the Parikh/abelianisation map
--    restricted to one coordinate at a time — and it is old.  What is
--    new here is only that this lane's `unfold` is a substitution and
--    that its three measures are weights, so the standard linear-algebra
--    statement about substitutions applies to them verbatim.
--
--  * `size` is `WitnessPolicy.size`, the node count, and `·` is
--    multiplication of natural numbers.  Nothing below measures anything
--    outside this model.

module Example where

  -- payload of size 2 over the vocabulary `0 ∷ []`; the head 1 is new.
  b₀ : Tm
  b₀ = node 0 (node 0 var)

  -- a target with TWO occurrences of the new head.
  t₂ : Tm
  t₂ = node 1 (node 1 var)

  -- a target with none.
  t₀ : Tm
  t₀ = node 0 var

  count-t₂ : count 1 t₂ ≡ 2
  count-t₂ = refl

  count-t₀ : count 1 t₀ ≡ 0
  count-t₀ = refl

  -- The law's two sides at t₂, each computed independently:
  --   degenerate output 0,  payload 2,  occurrences 2,  so 0 + 2·2 = 4.
  degenerate-at-t₂ : size (unfold 1 var t₂) ≡ 0
  degenerate-at-t₂ = refl

  -- ... while the payload itself, whose heads are all base, is untouched.
  payload-untouched : unfold 1 var b₀ ≡ b₀
  payload-untouched = refl

  lhs-t₂ : size (unfold 1 b₀ t₂) ≡ 4
  lhs-t₂ = refl

  rhs-t₂ : size (unfold 1 var t₂) + count 1 t₂ · size b₀ ≡ 4
  rhs-t₂ = refl

  -- FALSIFIER 1.  The naive law "one substitution adds the payload's
  -- size" is FALSE, and this is the witness: at a target with a single
  -- occurrence the substitution REPLACES a node rather than adding to
  -- it, so the size is 2, not 1 + 2.
  t₁ : Tm
  t₁ = node 1 var

  naive-refuted : ¬ (size (unfold 1 b₀ t₁) ≡ size t₁ + size b₀)
  naive-refuted p = znots (injSuc (injSuc p))

  -- ... and the true law gets it right.
  exact-at-t₁ : size (unfold 1 b₀ t₁) ≡ size (unfold 1 var t₁) + count 1 t₁ · size b₀
  exact-at-t₁ = size-unfold-exact 1 b₀ t₁

  -- FALSIFIER 2.  `policy-strict`'s hypothesis `0 < count d t` cannot be
  -- dropped: at a target the new head does not occur in, the two
  -- policies produce terms of EQUAL size, so no strict inequality holds
  -- there.  (`policy-dominates` still does, non-strictly.)
  policies-agree-off-head : size (unfold 1 var t₀) ≡ size (unfold 1 b₀ t₀)
  policies-agree-off-head = refl

  -- The other hypothesis is equally live: an obstruction whose payload
  -- is `var` makes the informative policy the degenerate one.
  empty-payload : (t : Tm) → size (unfold 1 var t) ≡ size (unfold 1 var t)
  empty-payload t = refl
