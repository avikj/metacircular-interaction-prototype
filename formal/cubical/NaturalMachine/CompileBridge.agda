-- NaturalMachine.CompileBridge
--
-- Discharging the hypothesis of `GenerativeLoop.Compile.generated-step-
-- improves`.
--
-- THE GAP THIS CLOSES.  `GenerativeLoop.Compile` proves: *given* an
-- obstruction `o` whose residual IS the `checkpoint` capability, one
-- obstruction-indexed proposal flips the compiler's branch from
-- `restart` to `resume`, at the same answer and strictly smaller counted
-- cost.  The hypothesis `residual o ≡ checkpoint` was assumed and
-- discharged nowhere: nothing said that running the generative loop on
-- anything ever PRODUCES such an obstruction.  This module supplies that
-- half, and hence the composite with no hypothesis dangling.
--
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED
--
-- D. The term/vocabulary side, in full generality (§D).
--
--   D1 `HeadOccurs`, `demands`  a task term DEMANDS a capability when
--                               that shape occurs as one of its heads;
--                               `demands` is the Bool decision, and the
--                               pair `demands-true` / `demands-occurs`
--                               makes it faithful (both directions, so
--                               the Bool is not decoration).
--   D2 `Over→memb`              if a vocabulary covers a task, every
--                               capability the task demands is installed.
--   D3 `Names`, `chain-names`   THE KEY LEMMA, and it is about chains,
--                               not about the probe's internals: if a
--                               shape is absent at the start of an
--                               `ObsChain` and present at its end, then
--                               SOME step of that chain has that shape as
--                               its obstruction's residual.  A chain
--                               installs one head per step and installs
--                               nothing else, so a head that appeared was
--                               named.
--   D4 `namedAt`                extracts the intermediate vocabulary and
--                               the obstruction itself from `Names`.
--
-- E. The bridge (module `Bridge k checkpoint`, §E).
--
--   E1 `loop-produces-checkpoint`
--                               THE HYPOTHESIS, DERIVED.  For every base
--                               vocabulary V in which `checkpoint` is not
--                               installed and every task term t that
--                               demands `checkpoint`, running
--                               `GenerativeLoop.generative-loop V t`
--                               yields a chain one of whose obstructions
--                               `o : Obstruction X` satisfies
--                               `residual o ≡ checkpoint`.
--                               Nothing is assumed; the term is built
--                               from `generative-loop` and D3.
--   E2 `generation-improves`    THE UNCONDITIONAL COMPOSITE.  Exactly the
--                               conclusion of `generated-step-improves`,
--                               with its hypothesis replaced by the two
--                               facts about the TASK (checkpoint not yet
--                               installed, task demands checkpoint).  The
--                               improvement is now derived, not
--                               hypothesised.
--
-- F. A compiler that is a function of the term too (§F).
--
--   `GenerativeLoop`'s disclaimer says §C "does not exhibit `Tm` terms
--   compiling to `Plan`s" — the compiler there reads only the vocabulary.
--   Here the compiler is a total function of the TERM as well.  READ §H
--   BEFORE READING THIS AS AN INTEGRATION: the term contributes exactly
--   one bit (which capability the task demands); the task's arithmetic
--   arguments are carried NATIVELY as `ℕ`, and §H proves they have to be.
--
--   F1 `compileTm : Vocab → Tm → ℕ → ℕ → Plan`
--                               the task term is scanned for the
--                               capability it demands; the vocabulary is
--                               consulted for whether that capability is
--                               installed; `m n : ℕ` are the task's own
--                               arguments and are NOT encoded in the term.
--   F2 `compileTm-agrees`       on tasks that demand `checkpoint` it
--                               agrees with the stipulated `compile`
--                               (so nothing new is smuggled in), and
--   F3 `compileTm-undemanding`  on tasks that do not demand it, it emits
--                               `restart` regardless of the vocabulary
--                               (a capability the task never asks for
--                               cannot change the program).
--   F4 `generation-compiles-better`
--                               E2 restated with `compileTm` in place of
--                               `compile`: ONE task term `t`, compiled
--                               before and after the generated step, to
--                               `restart` and then `resume`, same answer,
--                               strictly cheaper.
--
-- G. A concrete task, with everything computed (§G).
--
--   G1 `first-step-names-resume`
--                               `refl`.  On the concrete task
--                               `taskTm = node resumeCap (node tickCap
--                               (node readCap var))` over the concrete
--                               base vocabulary `tickCap ∷ readCap ∷ []`,
--                               the loop's OWN step function
--                               `generative-step` reduces to an
--                               obstruction whose residual is literally
--                               `resumeCap`.  Not "some step of the
--                               chain": the FIRST one, by computation.
--                               NEGATIVE CONTROL, landed and excluded
--                               from the aggregate because it must fail:
--                               `NaturalMachine/Control/WrongFirstStep.agda`
--                               asserts the same `refl` at `tickCap` and
--                               is rejected with `0 != 1 of type
--                               Agda.Builtin.Nat.Nat` (exit 42, error
--                               quoted verbatim in that file's header).
--                               So G1's `refl` is not the empty kind of
--                               `refl`.
--   G2 `taskObstruction`,
--      `taskObstruction-names`  that obstruction, extracted, with its
--                               naming proof.
--   G3 `ConcreteTask.task-step-improves`
--                               `generated-step-improves` applied at
--                               `baseVocab` and `taskObstruction` —
--                               the original conditional theorem with its
--                               condition supplied by G2.
--   G4 `ConcreteTask.task-compiles-better`
--                               F4 at the concrete task.
--   G5 `ConcreteTask.task-underdetermined`
--                               and the boundary at the same instance:
--                               after all of the above, the state
--                               (baseVocab , taskTm) still does not
--                               determine the answer (§H2 applied).
--
-- H. THE NEGATIVE RESULT: the loop's state underdetermines the answer.
--
--   `notes/GENERATIVE_LOOP_ARITHMETIC_BOUNDARY.md` (codex-vajra,
--   2026-08-13) proves that the natural arithmetic plug into this
--   substrate FAILS, by an exact collision: on Z/30 the signals
--   F = (1,…,1) and G = (2,…,2) generate the same order-1 cyclotomic
--   sector, hence translate to the identical formal term with identical
--   `deficit`, while their autocorrelations are (30,…,30) and
--   (120,…,120).  Support survives translation; coefficients do not.  So
--   no decoder from the present `Tm`/`Vocab` state recovers the
--   arithmetic answer, and encoding a sector number into a `Shape` would
--   be a bridge that passes the kernel while missing the mathematics.
--
--   That constraint is honoured here by proving its analogue INSIDE this
--   substrate rather than by asserting compliance:
--
--   H1 `answers-differ`         two runs of the improved plan at
--                               different arithmetic arguments compute
--                               different digit words (via `valueC` and
--                               `AcceptanceTest.replay-observed`, so the
--                               separation is by the certified observer,
--                               not by inspection of constructors).
--   H2 `state-underdetermines-answer`
--                               THE NO-GO, in vajra's shape:
--                               for EVERY vocabulary V and EVERY term t,
--                               there is no `decode : Vocab → Tm → CanWord`
--                               with `decode V t ≡ exec (resume m (suc n))`
--                               for all m, n.  One term, one vocabulary,
--                               many answers.  The loop's state names the
--                               capability; it does not carry the object.
--   H3 `decoder-exists-pointwise`
--                               POSITIVE CONTROL FOR H2, proved here.
--                               At FIXED `m n` the Σ-type H2 negates is
--                               inhabited (by a constant function).  So
--                               H2 is not true for want of an inhabitant
--                               of `CanWord` or by a degeneracy of `Σ`:
--                               it is exactly a statement about
--                               UNIFORMITY in the arguments — the
--                               quantifier `(m n : ℕ)` cannot be pushed
--                               inside.  The witness is constant, so this
--                               certifies non-vacuity and nothing more.
--
--   H2 is why `compileTm` takes `m n : ℕ` natively: that signature is
--   FORCED, not chosen.  §E-§G are exactly the part of the story that
--   survives H2 — which capability the task needs, whether generation
--   supplies it, and which of two plans is emitted — and nothing in
--   §E-§G decodes an arithmetic answer from a term.
--
-- I. The interface that would close what H2 leaves open (§I).
--
--   `ArithmeticPayload` is a record with vajra's five required items:
--   shape-indexed native data, a composition law, semantics from
--   installed payloads to answers, semantic preservation under
--   `unfold`, and a cost that is a separate field from the structural
--   measure — plus `payload-separates`, the field that demands the F/G
--   collision be resolvable.  IT IS DEFINED AND NOT INHABITED.  Nothing
--   in this file constructs one and no claim is made that one exists;
--   it is a named open joint in the style of
--   `CapabilityGraph.ObservationalClassCompiler`.
--
--   I2 `ArithmeticPayloadOver`  THE CORRECTED JOINT, and why it exists.
--   `notes/PAYLOAD_MORPHISM_BOUNDARY.md` (codex-vajra, 2026-08-13)
--   showed that `ArithmeticPayload` fixes DATA and never fixes the
--   TRANSFORMATIONS under which that data may be re-presented — so any
--   carrier or minimality notion it implies is underdetermined.  Its
--   instance: the k = 3 Möbius residual has unrestricted carrier rank 1
--   and graded carrier rank 3, the same payload under two morphism
--   classes.  That separation is now PROVED inside the substrate in
--   `NaturalMachine.PayloadMorphism` (§F there), together with the
--   chain-closure phenomenon of `notes/CHAIN_PAYLOAD_CLOSURE.md` (§G
--   there).  Accordingly `ArithmeticPayloadOver Ans M` takes the
--   morphism class `M` AS A PARAMETER and demands a minimal carrier IN
--   THAT CLASS; `payload-carrier-determined` then proves the demanded
--   number is unique, which is exactly what the parameter buys and what
--   `ArithmeticPayload` could not say.  IT TOO IS DEFINED AND NOT
--   INHABITED.
--
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * THE ONE STIPULATION IS `compileTm` (§F), and through it
--    `GenerativeLoop.Compile.compile`, which it delegates to.  It is a
--    four-line definition and it is the only place where a shape and a
--    plan meet.  Nothing here derives a compilation rule from anything;
--    what is derived is that the loop PRODUCES the capability the rule
--    consults, which is precisely the half that was missing.  If the
--    stipulated rule is rejected, everything downstream of it goes with
--    it; E1/D3 do not depend on it.
--  * Relatedly: `checkpoint : Shape` is a NAME, and the identification of
--    that name with "you may resume from a checkpoint" is carried by the
--    stipulation, not by the substrate.  `Shape = ℕ` has no semantics.
--    §G's `resumeCap`/`tickCap`/`readCap` are numerals with suggestive
--    identifiers; the mathematics is unchanged if they are renamed.
--  * E1 locates the checkpoint-naming step SOMEWHERE in the chain and
--    returns the intermediate vocabulary `X` at which it occurs.  It does
--    NOT claim the step is the first, nor that it is unique, nor that
--    `X ≡ V`.  Only in the concrete instance §G is the step shown to be
--    the first, and that is by computation on numerals (G1 is `refl`),
--    which generalises to nothing.  That the computation has a SPECIFIC
--    answer rather than being satisfied by any `refl` is the negative
--    control `NaturalMachine/Control/WrongFirstStep.agda` (excluded from
--    `NaturalMachine.agda`; it must fail, and does).
--  * H2 negates a Σ-type and is therefore worth nothing until that
--    Σ-type is known to be inhabitable.  It is, at fixed arguments:
--    H3 `decoder-exists-pointwise` in this file.  Both controls for this
--    module are landed and are cited by path, not described — the
--    positive one here as H3, the negative one at
--    `NaturalMachine/Control/WrongFirstStep.agda`.  Neither control
--    builds a decoder that reads anything off `(V , t)`: H3's witness is
--    a constant function and certifies non-vacuity only.
--  * D3 is a statement about `ObsChain`s, not about the loop's search
--    strategy.  It says a chain that made a head appear must have named
--    it.  It says nothing about which head the probe picks, in what
--    order, or whether that order is good.
--  * No optimality, no minimality: inherited from `GenerativeLoop` (the
--    step bound `chainLen ch ≤ deficit V t` is a bound).
--  * The cost model is inherited unchanged from `AcceptanceTest`: `cost`
--    counts `sucC` ticks a plan SCHEDULES, priced at one unit each.
--    "Strictly cheaper" means strictly fewer scheduled transitions of the
--    certified odometer.  No native-work theorem is claimed here, and the
--    open cost edge of the corpus is not closed.
--  * NO ARITHMETIC INTEGRATION IS CLAIMED, and by H2 none is available
--    from this state.  In particular §F does NOT unify the substrates:
--    `compileTm` reads one bit off the term (`demands checkpoint t`) and
--    takes the task's numbers natively.  A reader who wants "the term
--    determines the program" gets only that bit; everything numerical is
--    passed around the term, not through it.  The corresponding sector-
--    number encoding, which would look like integration, is refused here
--    on vajra's grounds and is not present anywhere in this file.
--  * H2 is a no-go about DECODERS FROM THE STATE, not an impossibility
--    theorem about the enterprise: it says a function of `(Vocab , Tm)`
--    cannot be the answer.  It does not say no extension of the substrate
--    can carry the answer — §I names one that could.  §I is not proved to
--    be sufficient, only to be a type; and no term of it is built.
--  * NEITHER §I RECORD IS INHABITED, and `ArithmeticPayloadOver` is not
--    claimed to be sufficient either — it is `ArithmeticPayload` with
--    one omission repaired, not a construction.  Its `carrier` field
--    demands a minimal carrier for a task's ANSWER in the declared
--    class; nothing here relates that number to `deficit`, and the
--    corpus's termination measure remains the structural one.  The
--    morphism class the ARITHMETIC wants is still unfixed (see the "not
--    claimed" section of `NaturalMachine.PayloadMorphism`): what is
--    fixed is that the interface must name one.
--  * `ArithmeticPayload` is kept, superseded, so that the correction is
--    legible; it is not deleted and it is not inhabited.
--  * The witness policy is still degenerate wherever the loop builds
--    obstructions (`witness = var`); conservativity holds for any base
--    witness, and nothing here makes bodies informative.
--  * Everything inherited from `Obstruction`'s and `GenerativeLoop`'s
--    disclaimers stands: single-parameter bodies, matching only at the
--    root, no arity structure in the residual, gates D2-D7 unmodelled,
--    and no relation to the Python runtime in `runtime/vocabulary/`.
