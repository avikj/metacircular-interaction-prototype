-- SOURCE, WITH TEXT AND DATE.
--
--   Pāṇini, *Aṣṭādhyāyī*, c. 500 BCE.  The fourteen sūtras standing at
--   its head (śiva-sūtrāṇi / māheśvara-sūtrāṇi) lay every sound of
--   Sanskrit in ONE linear order, each sūtra closing in an अनुबन्ध
--   (it-marker).  The abbreviation is licensed by A 1.1.71
--   आदिरन्तेन सहेता — *ādir antyena sahetā*, "an initial [sound] together
--   with a final इत् [denotes the sounds in between]"; the it-status of
--   the closing consonant is A 1.3.3 हलन्त्यम् *halantyam*, and its
--   elision A 1.3.9 तस्य लोपः *tasya lopaḥ*.
--
--   ह occurs TWICE in the fourteen: in the fifth sūtra हयवरट् and again,
--   alone, in the fourteenth हल्.  ण् likewise occurs twice as an
--   अनुबन्ध, closing the first (अ इ उ ण्) and the sixth (ल ण्).
--
--   COMMENTARY LAYER, named and NOT read here: Kātyāyana's vārttikas and
--   Patañjali's *Mahābhāṣya* (c. 150 BCE) are where the repetition of ह
--   and the two ण् are argued.  Egress is blocked from this container
--   (`notes/ELSEWHERE_CONDITION_IS_INCOMPLETE.md` records EGRESS_BLOCKED
--   as of 2026-08-19); nothing below rests on a commentary reading, and
--   no commentator's position is reported.
--
-- WHAT IS CLAIMED OF PĀṆINI.  Only the data: the fourteen sūtras in the
-- order given, the it-markers as given, ह twice, ण् twice.  That
-- encoding is corroborated against an independent implementation from
-- inside the tradition present in this container —
-- `/root/agda-libs/vidyut/vidyut-prakriya/src/sounds.rs`, whose `SUTRAS`
-- table is sound-for-sound and marker-for-marker the same list, and
-- whose scan (like `from` below) starts at the FIRST occurrence of the
-- initial sound and disambiguates the second ण् by an external
-- convention it names `R2`.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED OF PĀṆINI.  That he stated, considered, or would
-- accept the theorem below.  Intersection-closure of the family of
-- nameable classes is not a question the Aṣṭādhyāyī poses.  No claim
-- about which classes his rules actually require — that family is
-- philological and is not enumerated here.  No claim about optimality:
-- Petersen 2004, *A Mathematical Analysis of Pāṇini's Śivasūtras*, JoLLI
-- 13:471–489, is still unread here for the reason above, and §6 states
-- explicitly why the theorem below does not bear on it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE QUESTION, AND TWO ANSWERS THAT DIFFER
--
-- Is the family of classes nameable by the device closed under
-- non-empty intersection?
--
--   FROM THE SYMMETRY.  A pratyāhāra is an interval of one linear
--   order.  Intervals are closed under intersection.  The construction
--   is equivariant under every relabelling of the sounds that fixes the
--   markers (§4, proved), so the answer cannot depend on which sound
--   sits where; it is a structural invariant of the interval
--   representation, and it is YES.
--
--   FROM THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECT.  What the device names is not the
--   interval but its IMAGE under the position→sound labelling, and that
--   labelling is not injective: ह occupies two positions.  Images of an
--   intersection-closed family under a non-injective map need not be
--   intersection-closed.  So the answer is not fixed by the symmetry and
--   has to be computed on the individual string.
--
-- Computed on the individual string it is NO (§5), by one witness:
--
--       हश् ∩ शल्  =  { ह } ,   and { ह } bears no name.
--
-- The equivariance of §4 is exact and it is blind to this: `map σ` of
-- the list still carries σ(ह) twice, so the invariant transports the
-- failure instead of detecting it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--
--   §3  the classical pratyāhāras by refl on the full fourteen,
--       including the pair अण् / यण् that turns on the SECOND ण्, and
--       हल् = 34 entries denoting 33 consonants;
--   §4  relabelling equivariance of `from`, `upto`, `between`, by list
--       induction — the symmetry statement, in full generality;
--   §5  हश् ∩ शल् ≡ ह ∷ [], and `ह ∷ []` is named by NO legal pair
--       (sound , anubandha) — all 42 × 13 = 546 refuted; packaged as
--       `intersection-closure-fails` and as `not-intersection-closed`;
--   §5b the two ILLEGAL pairs that do name it, kept because they show
--       the result is sharp in both of Pāṇini's endpoint restrictions,
--       and because they killed a claim of mine (see §5's note);
--   §6  MY OWN REPAIR, STATED AND KILLED.  Searching the LAST occurrence
--       of the initial sound makes { ह } nameable and destroys हल् and
--       हश् — the two classes the repetition exists to supply.
--
-- STANDING ON EARLIER WORK, none of it re-landed.  `Sivasutra.agda`
-- (cf-sakshi, 2026-08-18) checks `upto` on the vowel prefix;
-- `NaturalMachine.NonInitialPratyaharasAndOneIntersectionInstance` adds
-- the start-search `from`, the two-endpoint `between`, and ONE
-- intersection instance on that prefix, declining closure explicitly:
-- *"§3 is an instance, not closure … the consonant sūtras are still
-- absent."*  This module supplies the consonant sūtras and settles the
-- declined question in the negative.  `NaturalMachine.Pratyahara` proves
-- at three letters that repetition is FORCED and that one repetition
-- SUFFICES for totality; `NaturalMachine.PratyaharaBuysTotalityWithLocality`
-- proves the repetition costs LOCALITY (one name, two sets).  §5 is a
-- third cost, distinct from both and not implied by either: the family
-- of denoted SETS loses intersection-closure.
--
-- `Sym`, `isMarker`, `eqSym`, `from`, `upto`, `between` are restated here
-- rather than imported because `Sivasutra.Sym` carries the nine vowels
-- and four markers only; the definitions are the earlier ones unchanged.
--
-- CHECKED on the container: Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 — NOT the declared
-- repository pin (2.8.0 + v0.9).  --cubical --safe, no postulates, no
-- holes.

-- list, every σ, every start and every marker.
--
-- The conserved quantity is the SHAPE of the family — which positions
-- each name picks out.  Which sound sits at a position is not a
-- variable the extractor sees.

-- 5.  THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECT, AND WHERE IT DIFFERS FROM THE SYMMETRY
--
-- `nameable` ranges over the forty-two distinct sounds as ādi and the
-- thirteen distinct anubandhas as antya it: 546 candidate pairs, which
-- is exactly what A 1.1.71 with A 1.3.3 licenses.
--
-- A SECOND CLAIM OF MINE, KILLED BY THE CHECKER BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN
-- DOWN.  The first version of this section quantified both endpoints
-- over all fifty-six symbols, on the reasoning that a larger candidate
-- set makes a `≡ false` strictly stronger.  Agda returned `true`.  Two
-- illegal pairs name { ह } and are checked in §5b: `between ha ya`,
-- which stops at a SOUND, and `between R L`, which starts at an
-- it-MARKER.  Neither is a pratyāhāra — the antya must be an इत् (A
-- 1.3.3 हलन्त्यम्) and an इत् is elided and is not a sound of the
-- language (A 1.3.9 तस्य लोपः).  So the negative result is exactly as
-- strong as the device's own two restrictions and no stronger, and the
-- reasoning "wider is stronger" was wrong: widening the candidate set
-- does not widen the theorem, it changes the object.

-- CLAIM R (mine, and the first repair I reached for).  The failure at

-- initial sound.  Take the LAST occurrence instead and { ह } becomes
-- nameable — `between ha L` then runs from sūtra 14's ह to ल् and
-- denotes exactly { ह } — so closure is restored by a one-line change to
-- the extractor and nothing about the śiva-sūtras is at stake.
--
-- The first half of Claim R is TRUE and is checked below.  The claim is
-- still false, and §6b is what kills it: under last-occurrence search,
-- हल् and हश् are not merely different — they are unnameable.  `fromLast
-- ha` can never again reach sūtra 5, so no pair whatever names the
-- consonants or the voiced consonants.
--
-- So the convention is not free and not arbitrary.  First-occurrence
-- search is what the repetition of ह is FOR: it is the convention under
-- which the second ह extends हल् to the end of the list rather than
-- starting a new class.  Claim R traded one unnameable set for two, and
-- the two it lost are classes the Aṣṭādhyāyī uses constantly.
--
-- Recorded rather than deleted, per this repository's practice.

-- 7.  WHAT §5 DOES AND DOES NOT BEAR ON
--
-- IT DOES NOT TOUCH PETERSEN 2004.  That theorem concerns the family of
-- classes Pāṇini's rules REQUIRE, and asks whether a linear order
-- represents it by intervals — and, given that it does, whether his
-- order is minimal.  §5 concerns the family the device GENERATES, which
-- is larger: every (start, marker) pair, whether or not any rule uses
-- it.  A required family can be intersection-closed while the generated
-- family is not, and { ह } is precisely a set no rule needs a
-- two-symbol name for.  The two statements do not contradict and neither
-- implies the other.
--
-- IT DOES CONSTRAIN A READING ALREADY IN THIS CORPUS.
-- `notes/INDIC_FORMAL_TRADITIONS_MAP.md` §1.1 records the śiva-sūtras as
-- "an interval representation of an intersection-closed set family over
-- a linear order".  Read as a statement about the required family that
-- is the received claim and nothing here disturbs it.  Read as a
-- statement about the device — as the shorter phrase "the pratyāhāras
-- are intersection-closed" invites — it is false, and §5 is the
-- counterexample.  The distinction is exactly the non-injectivity of the
-- labelling, which is exactly the repeated ह.
--
-- THE COST LEDGER OF THE REPETITION, NOW THREE ENTRIES, EACH CHECKED IN
-- A DIFFERENT MODULE.  Repetition buys totality (`Pratyahara`, forced at
-- three letters; one repetition suffices).  It costs locality
-- (`PratyaharaBuysTotalityWithLocality`: one name, two sets — the अण्
-- ambiguity).  It costs intersection-closure of the generated family
-- (§5).  The third is not a corollary of the second: the collision in
-- that module is between two runs sharing a NAME, and § 5's failure is
-- between two SETS with no shared name at all.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL OPEN.  Whether { ह } is the ONLY non-empty intersection
-- of two nameable classes that is itself unnameable.  §5 exhibits one;
-- an exhaustive sweep over all 56 × 56 ordered pairs of classes is a
-- finite computation and is NOT run here — the derivation says the
-- failures can only arise where the labelling is non-injective, i.e.
-- only at ह, but that is an argument and not a check, and this file
-- publishes no unchecked count.
