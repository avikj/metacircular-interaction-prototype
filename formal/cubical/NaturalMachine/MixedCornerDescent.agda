-- NaturalMachine.MixedCornerDescent
--
-- Factory IV §X, Theorem 70 — "mixed-corner descent" — as a checked
-- well-founded descent, i.e. as the SPECIFICATION its compiler would
-- have to meet, with nothing arithmetic smuggled in.
--
-- WHERE THIS COMES FROM.  The owner's delta
-- `collab/upstream/library/raw/ETERNAL_GOLDEN_BRAID_THEOREM_FACTORY_IV_2026-08-14.md`
-- §X ("The mixed radius–charge compiler") sets e = Ω − 1 ∈ {0,1}, takes
-- the state space V_R = {1,…,R} × {0,1} with (r,0) an exact prime pair at
-- radius r and (r,1) a prime–semiprime pair at radius r, target (1,0),
-- and defines the boxed rank
--
--     κ(r,e) = 2(r−1) + e,          unique zero (1,0).
--
-- Theorem 70 then reads: if every reachable non-target state has a
-- bounded proof-carrying transition v → v′ with κ(v′) < κ(v) and the
-- center strictly increasing, then twin primes are infinite.  Its whole
-- mathematical content is the descent — "the natural-number rank
-- strictly decreases; the process terminates at its unique rank-zero
-- state" — and that content is finite, decidable, and belongs in a
-- proof assistant rather than in prose.  Receiving audit:
-- `notes/FACTORY_IV_CHEN_CORNER_AUDIT.md` §3, which grades Theorem 70
-- "correct as stated and content-free until a single mixed edge
-- (r,0) → (s,1) has an arithmetic instance; none exists in the
-- literature known here."  This module is written to that grade: the
-- descent half is discharged completely, the arithmetic half is
-- declared missing, and the interface between them is a type, so that
-- an edge theorem — if one is ever proved — composes with this for
-- free.  Sibling formalizations of the same §: `ChenProjector.agda`
-- (Theorem 58, the charge projector), `CornerProjectors.agda` (§XI,
-- P_r P_c = P_c P_r together with the marginal-to-joint counterexample),
-- `ThreeChannels.agda` (the channel refinement of the projector).
--
-- THE HILBERT MOVE.  Axiomatize, then decide.  Everything Theorem 70
-- says about *arithmetic* is quarantined into one abstract datum
--
--     Descent = (s : State) → ¬ (κ s ≡ 0) → Σ[ t ∈ State ] (κ t < κ s)
--
-- — "every non-corner state has a next state, carrying a proof that the
-- rank drops" — and everything it says about *termination* is then a
-- theorem with no hypotheses left to argue about.  The Σ is the point:
-- the transition and its certificate travel together, so the compiler
-- cannot emit an edge it has not justified.  Factory IV's own gain over
-- Factory III is visible in this type and only here: Factory III
-- admitted (r,0) → (s,0) with s < r; the mixed datum admits
-- (r,0) → (r−1,1), trading one unit of charge for one unit of radius and
-- purifying later through (1,1) → (1,0).  Both are instances of the same
-- Descent, which is why the mixed compiler is strictly more permissive
-- and terminates just as surely.
--
-- COORDINATES.  State = ℕ × Bool with the first coordinate r ∸ 1 (so
-- Factory IV's radius-one target is our 0) and the second coordinate the
-- charge defect e as a Bool.  Then κ(r,e) = 2·r + e is `rank`, defined by
-- structural recursion so that it computes, and the corner is (0,false).
-- Reindexing by r ∸ 1 is not cosmetic: it makes "unique zero" a statement
-- about ℕ's own zero, so rank-zero uniqueness is three pattern matches
-- rather than an inequality argument, and it removes the bound R, which
-- Theorem 70 never uses (the descent is well-founded on all of ℕ × Bool;
-- R is a bookkeeping convenience in the source).
--
-- WHY FUEL, AND NOT WELL-FOUNDED RECURSION.  The trajectory is built by
-- structural recursion on a fuel argument k with the invariant κ s ≤ k,
-- started at k = κ s and closed by ≤-refl — the choice, and the discipline
-- of *proving that the chosen fuel suffices* rather than assuming it,
-- is taken from `formal/pairfield/Pairfield/WalkFalsifier.lean`, whose
-- header states it exactly: "everything here is written by structural
-- recursion on fuel, not by well-founded recursion, precisely so that
-- `decide` can reduce it in the kernel.  A well-founded definition would
-- be executable by `#eval` and *not* provable by `decide`.  Choosing fuel
-- is choosing which of the three modes the object supports."  The same
-- trade holds here with `refl` in place of `decide`: because `descend`
-- recurses structurally on fuel and every ingredient computes, the
-- trajectory of a concrete start state is available BY EVALUATION
-- (`example-trajectory` below is a `refl`), which an accessibility-based
-- definition would not give under `--safe` without extra work.  Fuel is
-- not a weakening: `fuel-suffices` is the theorem that κ(start) is enough,
-- so nothing is assumed that is not proved.
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   State, corner, rank, κ   the mixed state space and Factory IV's rank
--   rank-zero-unique         κ s ≡ 0 → s ≡ (0,false): the corner is the
--                            unique zero of the rank — Theorem 70's
--                            "its unique rank-zero state"
--   corner-rank              κ corner ≡ 0, the converse half
--   rank-zero-contr          the two together, sharpened: the fiber of κ
--                            over 0 is CONTRACTIBLE, so "the target" is
--                            well-defined as a type, not merely as a
--                            named element
--   Descent                  the proof-carrying transition datum (Σ-data:
--                            next state ⊗ certificate that κ drops)
--   Reaches                  the reachability predicate generated by a

--                            saturating traj-bound
--
-- WHAT IS *NOT* CLAIMED — read this before citing anything above.
--
--   1. No twin-prime statement, and no step toward one.  Theorem 70's
--      conclusion ("then twin primes are infinite") is NOT formalized and
--      is not derivable from anything here, because its hypothesis is not
--      formalized either: the hypothesis is arithmetic and this module is
--      combinatorial.
--   2. NO ARITHMETIC INSTANCE OF ANY EDGE EXISTS.  `mixedDescent` inhabits
--      `Descent` on the *abstract* state space ℕ × Bool; it moves labels,
--      not prime pairs.  A real edge would be a theorem of the form "from
--      a prime pair at radius r there is a bounded, proof-carrying
--      construction of a prime–semiprime pair at radius r−1 with center
--      strictly larger", and the audit records that no such theorem is
--      known here, on either the mixed leg or the purifying leg
--      (1,1) → (1,0) — the latter being, in Factory IV §XII's own words,
--      the full problem.  So the inhabitant witnesses that the SPEC is
--      satisfiable, not that ARITHMETIC satisfies it.  Nothing in this
--      file is evidence about the integers.
--   3. The "center strictly increases" clause of Theorem 70 is not
--      modelled.  It is what makes the produced family cofinal (hence
--      infinitude rather than a single pair); it is orthogonal to the
--      descent and would be carried as a second component of the datum
--      once an edge exists to carry it.  Declaring it absent is cheaper
--      than pretending a ℕ-valued center adds content while the edges are
--      empty.
--   4. Therefore, per the `DO_NOT_DO_THIS_it_felt_like_progress_and_added_nothing/`
--      discipline and `notes/FACTORY_IV_CHEN_CORNER_AUDIT.md` §3's grading
--      of exactly this theorem: THIS MODULE IS SCAFFOLDING, LABELLED AS
--      SUCH.  Its value is entirely conditional and entirely explicit —
--      when an edge theorem arrives, it is applied to `descend` and the
--      trajectory, its length bound, and its endpoint are obtained with
--      no further work.  That is a real saving of exactly one page, and
--      claiming more would be the failure mode the ledger is named for.

-- §1  The mixed state space and Factory IV's rank.
--
-- Factory IV's V_R = {1,…,R} × {0,1} is reindexed by r ↦ r ∸ 1 and
-- unbounded (the bound R plays no role in the descent).  The charge
-- defect e = Ω − 1 is a Bool because it is a two-valued coordinate and
-- nothing here does arithmetic with it beyond "is it set".
--
-- κ(r,e) = 2·r + e is defined by structural recursion rather than as
-- `2 * r + …` so that it computes on constructors: every statement below
-- about a concrete state is then closed by refl, which is the whole
-- reason the fuel discipline is worth its cost (see the header).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

rank (suc r) e     = suc (suc (rank r e))

κ : State → ℕ
κ (r , e) = rank r e

-- The one arithmetic fact about the rank that the descent needs: raising
-- the charge defect costs exactly one, which is why a mixed edge
-- (r,0) → (r−1,1) is a strict gain (two units of radius bought, one unit
-- of charge spent).  Everything else follows from this by pattern match.

-- §2  Rank-zero uniqueness — Theorem 70's "unique rank-zero state".
--
-- Stated in three forms of increasing strength: the implication, the

-- Carried as Σ-data so the two cannot be separated — an edge without its
-- certificate is not an element of this type, which is the formal content
-- of "proof-carrying transition".
--
-- Note what is deliberately absent: any bound on the transition (Factory
-- IV's "bounded"), any center, any arithmetic.  The bound and the center
-- are what make the produced family cofinal; they are orthogonal to
-- termination and are declared missing in the header rather than modelled
-- vacuously.
