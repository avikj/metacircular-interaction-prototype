-- TARGET.md §6 item 2, executed: read `BARRIER.md` §3 Problem 2 — the
-- oracle model separating VALUE queries from FUNCTIONAL-EQUATION queries
-- — against `ChargeCriterion`.  The prediction there was "they should be
-- the same distinction stated twice; if they are not, the difference is
-- the finding."  They are the same distinction, and the identification
-- is a theorem, not a reading:
--
--   **A functional-equation comparison cannot be parity-neutral.**
--
-- A value query reads val σ n at an argument n of the method's choosing,
-- and `ChargeCriterion` classified these: a value-query set separates the
-- gauge pair iff it contains an odd-Ω argument.  A method can choose to
-- stay neutral.
--
-- A functional-equation query — the interface entropy decrement consumes,
-- λ(pn) = −λ(n) used as a constraint — compares val at n and at p·n.
-- But Ω(p·n) = Ω(n) + 1, so THE TWO ENDS OF AN FE COMPARISON ALWAYS LIE
-- IN OPPOSITE PARITY SECTORS: whichever sector n is in, pn is in the
-- other.  A method with FE access cannot stay neutral even if it wants
-- to — any query set closed under a single FE comparison contains an
-- odd-Ω argument, hence (by `ChargeCriterion.odd⇒separator`) admits a
-- separator.
--
-- WHY THIS IS THE MECHANISM AND NOT A COINCIDENCE.  Multiplication by a
-- prime is a DEGREE-ONE SHIFT of the Ω-grading, and parity is the
-- truncation of that grading (`ChargeGrading`, Delta 15 §15.7).  T15.27
-- there says a degree-δ operation changes parity by δ mod 2, and
-- `parity-moving-shifts` says an odd shift moves the parity of EVERY
-- sector it touches — "no observer refinement can prevent it, because
-- the shift is what moves."  δ = 1 is odd.  That checked statement, two
-- modules old, is why the FE interface carries charge: the interface's
-- one primitive is an odd shift.
--
-- So three things said in three places are one thing:
--
--   BARRIER.md   "entropy decrement ∉ WL by the interface it consumes"
--   GAUGE.md     "parity-sensitive conclusions require coupling to
--                 something outside the neutral sector"
--   ChargeGrading/ChargeCriterion (here): the FE primitive is a degree-1
--                 shift; degree-1 shifts are parity-moving; parity-moving
--                 queries are exactly the separating ones.
--
-- What was DEFINITIONAL in BARRIER.md ("outside WL by construction")
-- becomes STRUCTURAL here: the FE interface does not happen to sit
-- outside the neutral class, it CANNOT sit inside it.  That is not yet
-- W3 — W3 asks whether value queries can SIMULATE FE queries, a
-- lower-bound question this module does not touch — but it is the half
-- of W3 that can be had exactly: the two interfaces differ in charge,
-- provably, so a simulation would have to manufacture charge from
-- neutral readings, and `no-decision` says post-processing alone cannot.
--
-- Contents (no holes, no postulates, --safe):
--
--   FEPair                     the two ends of an FE comparison
--   fe-flips-parity            Ω(p·n) has the opposite parity of Ω(n)
--   fe-crosses-sectors         hence one end is always odd —
--                              as a decided disjunction, not a case split
--                              left to the reader
--   fe-has-charge              an FE comparison anywhere in the query set
--                              yields HasOdd
--   fe⇒separator               …and hence a constructed separator
--   value-can-hide             contrast: a nonempty pure-value query set
--                              with no separator (probe-6 re-exported in
--                              this vocabulary)
--   fe-ratio-is-the-sign       the ratio the FE constraint propagates IS
--                              σ(p) — charge-one data on the nose
--
-- NOT claimed: any lower bound (that value queries cannot simulate FE
-- queries at some cost — W3 proper).  Not claimed: anything about the
-- entropy-decrement PROOF; only about the interface it reads.  The
-- Friedlander–Iwaniec bilinear axiom and Vinogradov type-II sums consume
-- interfaces of the same charged shape, which is consistent with, and
-- predicted by, GAUGE.md §F.3 — but that identification is prose, not
-- a checked term, and stays in the note.

-- §5  What the FE constraint actually transports.
--
-- The relation λ(pn) = −λ(n) propagates the RATIO val σ (p·n) / val σ n,

-- prime.  So the FE interface is not merely "somewhere charged": its
-- transported datum is the generator of the charged sector.  This is the
-- exact sense in which entropy decrement "accesses a's functional
-- equation" (BARRIER.md): each use reads one prime's sign.
