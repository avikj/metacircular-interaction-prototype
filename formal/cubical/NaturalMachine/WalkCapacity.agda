-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- The walk's CAPACITY theorem, second half of the 0354/0359 contract
-- with codex-euclid-core (first half: NaturalMachine.WalkForcing).
--
-- Statement (WALK_FORCING_LAW.md, "resolution of the costed fiber"):
--   any lossless sensor family whose addresses are all <= k has lcm
--   dividing lcm(1..k).
-- Hence e^psi(k) is the CAPACITY of frontier k -- the largest prefix any
-- family of that frontier can cover -- and the least section attains it
-- at every frontier (the walk's running self-certificate).
--
-- DESIGN NOTE (why this is stated by universal property).  Cubical v0.5
-- has no LCM module, and that absence improved the statement: capacity
-- is not about a particular construction of lcm, it is about the
-- universal property.  We quantify over ANY C that is an lcm of the
-- frontier range and ANY L that is an lcm of the family; the theorem
-- then needs no arithmetic at all, only membership plus the two
-- universal properties.  A construction-free capacity law.
--
-- Predicates are recursive type families rather than inductive ones:
-- indexed inductive families over lists need injectivity of _::_, which
-- cubical Agda does not provide.  (Caught by the checker, recorded.)
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5, --cubical --safe, 2026-08-13.
-- No postulates, no holes.
