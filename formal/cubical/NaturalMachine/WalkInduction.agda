-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

{-# OPTIONS --cubical --safe --no-import-sorts #-}

-- The induction ALONG the walk: NaturalMachine.WalkStream's single
-- install step, lifted to the whole trajectory.
--
-- Setting.  The walk's state is a pair (S , k): S the list of installed
-- sensors, k the frontier (the address most recently installed).  It
-- starts at ([] , 0) and its only transition is the walk's own policy —
-- read L = lcm S, take q = the least non-divisor of L (≥ 2, the walk's
-- search bound), and move to (q ∷ S , q).  `Reach n S k` says "(S , k)
-- is reachable in exactly n installs"; `Reach` is a RECURSIVE type
-- family over the step count, not an indexed inductive family over
-- lists, because cubical Agda will not unify a constructor in a list
-- index position (the same constraint recorded in WalkCapacity).
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED
--
--   invariant     (i)  : the walk's invariant is preserved by one step.
--                        Invariant = "every installed sensor lies in
--                        [1,k]" AND "any lcm of S is an lcm of
--                        range1 k".  This is `installStream` plus the
--                        frontier-jump lemma below.
--   reach-Inv          : hence every reachable state satisfies it —
--                        the induction along the walk.
--   reach-capacity(ii) : every reachable state's lcm IS an lcm of
--                        range1 (its frontier).  This is the Agda form
--                        of runtime/walk.py's capacity_certificate:
--                        the walk is at the capacity of its own
--                        frontier at every step, not merely at the end.
--   reach-capacity-≡   : the same as an equation between numbers,
--                        lcm S ≡ lcm (1..k), by antisymmetry of ∣.
--   reach-dominates    : the optimality reading — no lossless family
--                        with addresses ≤ k has an lcm the reachable
--                        state's lcm does not already divide-cover
--                        (WalkCapacity.capacity evaluated along the
--                        trajectory).
--   walk-1, walk-2     : the trajectory is INHABITED: the first two
--                        states ([2] , 2) and ([3,2] , 3) are exhibited
--                        with their reachability data, so none of the
--                        above is vacuously true of an empty relation.
--
-- FRONTIER JUMP.  The one new lemma: if L is an lcm of range1 k and q
-- is a least non-divisor of L with 0 < q, then k < q.  (Otherwise q is
-- a member of range1 k, so q ∣ L.)  This is what discharges
-- installStream's hypothesis "all installed sensors lie in [1,q)" from
-- the weaker invariant "all lie in [1,k]" — i.e. it is the reason the
-- single step composes into an induction at all.
--
-- WHAT IS WEAKENED, honestly:
--
--   * The step relation carries `2 ≤ q` and `IsLCM S L` as explicit
--     hypotheses, exactly as WalkStream does.  `2 ≤ q` is the walk's
--     declared search bound (LeastNonDivisor alone does not give
--     0 < q); `IsLCM S L` is an existence assumption for the lcm, which
--     cubical v0.5 has no module to construct.  So `Reach` describes
--     runs of the walk in which the machine's read of lcm(S) is
--     supplied, rather than proving that read exists.  Both hypotheses
--     are supplied concretely in walk-1 and walk-2, which is why those
--     witnesses are included: they show the hypotheses are satisfiable
--     and not silently empty.
--   * Statement (2) of notes/WALK_FORCING_LAW.md — that the installs
--     are exactly the ordered prime powers — is NOT attempted.  It
--     needs prime-power machinery beyond WalkForcing's "no proper
--     coprime splitting".
--   * `Reach` is indexed by an exact install count n.  Nothing is lost
--     (Σ over n gives plain reachability) but no reflexive-transitive
--     closure is constructed.
--
-- Nothing here re-proves WalkStream; the file's content is the
-- frontier-jump lemma, the trajectory, and the induction that carries
-- the step along it.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5, --cubical --safe, 2026-08-13.
-- No postulates, no holes.
