-- NaturalMachine.SuccessorIsNotTropical
--
-- Companion to `SumProductTorus`.  There the multiplicative world was
-- shown to be the tropical world in disguise: derivations add, numbers
-- multiply; derivations take pointwise max, numbers take lcm; and the two
-- cohere by max-over-plus.  In that chart multiplication is trivial.
--
-- This module says what the chart costs, and the answer is sharp:
--
--     the successor has NO locality in it whatsoever.
--
-- Not "is complicated".  Consecutive integers are coprime, so the
-- derivations of n and n+1 share **not one coordinate**.  Every single
-- step along ℕ is a total jump in the chart where multiplication is easy.
-- The two structures on the same set do not merely fail to commute — they
-- have disjoint support at every step.
--
-- That is this repository's central difficulty, stated exactly and
-- elementarily.  Sieve and multiplicative methods live in the tropical
-- chart because that is where their objects are simple; additive
-- questions — Goldbach, gaps, pairs — are questions about the successor;
-- and the successor is the one map with no expression there.  The
-- "parity barrier" is a chart incompatibility, and `disjoint-support`
-- below is its whole content.
--
-- Nothing here is deep.  `gcd(n, n+1) = 1` is known to every schoolchild
-- who has thought about it for a minute.  What is not standard is
-- reading it as the obstruction: the fact everyone knows IS the barrier
-- everyone describes, once you notice that the multiplicative world is a
-- chart and ask what fails to transport.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — the container, NOT the repository
-- pin (2.8.0 / v0.9, BUILD.md).  No postulates, no holes.

-- ℕ has no subtraction, so the usual one-line proof is unavailable and

-- a < b, and then b = j + (a+1) makes (j+1)·d = 1 by cancellation.

-- 3.  Three concrete failures of transport, by computation.

-- 4.  What this says, for the record.
--
-- `SumProductTorus` gives ℕ's multiplicative structure a chart in which
-- it is free: derivations under +, join under max, the two cohering
-- tropically.  Every multiplicative question becomes easy there.
--
-- `disjoint-support` says the successor is invisible in that chart, in
-- the strongest possible sense — not distorted, not expensive, but
-- supported on coordinates disjoint from the ones it came from.
--
-- So the two structures ℕ carries are not two views of one object that
-- some clever transport will reconcile.  There is a chart for each, and
-- the transition map between them has no locality at any point.  Every
-- method that works multiplicatively is working in one chart, every
-- additive question is asked in the other, and nothing carries across
-- because at every single step the coordinates are disjoint.
--
-- The honest consequence: looking for the obstruction inside either
-- chart is looking in the wrong place.  It is not in the sieve and it is
-- not in the walk — both are single-chart objects, and this module says
-- what happens between charts.  The object to build is the transition
-- itself.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5.  ADDENDUM, 2026-08-18 — scope of §4, added without altering it.
--
-- §4 above reads `disjoint-support` as "the parity barrier is a chart
-- incompatibility" and calls it "its whole content".  That reading is
-- scoped and the scope was not stated: the theorem is about ℕ **with the
-- successor**, whose generator 1 is a unit and therefore multiplicatively
-- invisible by construction.  It is not a theorem about arithmetic
-- carrying two structures.
--
-- `NaturalMachine.PythagoreanTransition` keeps the ring and changes the
-- additive law to Brahmagupta's composition (bhāvanā at D = −1, 628 CE).
-- There the successor's analogue satisfies
--
--     N (u ⊗ g) ≡ N u · N g
--
-- — multiplication by a constant in the very chart where ℕ's successor
-- has no support at all.  Total locality against zero locality, same
-- chart.  So the incompatibility measured here belongs to the line.
--
-- The closing sentence of §4 — "the object to build is the transition
-- itself" — is answered there by `gen-hom`: squaring is a monoid
-- homomorphism from the parameter chart to the triple chart, so Euclid's
-- parametrisation IS the transition, with no defect.
--
-- Everything proved in §§1–3 stands unchanged.  See
-- notes/THE_BARRIER_BELONGS_TO_THE_LINE.md.
