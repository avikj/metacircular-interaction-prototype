-- SOURCE, WITH TEXT AND DATE.
--
--   Bharata, *Nāṭyaśāstra* ch. 28 (c. 200 BCE – 200 CE).  The 22 śrutis of
--   the octave are established by the *sāraṇā* procedure: two vīṇās tuned
--   identically, one of them (the *calā*, moving) displaced by one śruti at
--   a time while the other (the *dhruvā*, fixed) is held, and the
--   coincidences between the two instruments observed.  The fourfold form,
--   *sāraṇā-catuṣṭaya*, is set out in Abhinavagupta's *Abhinavabhāratī*
--   (c. 1000 CE) at NŚ 28.26.  Śārṅgadeva, *Saṅgītaratnākara* I
--   (c. 1210–1247 CE), tabulates the resulting 4-3-2-4-4-3-2 division of
--   the 22.  Matanga, *Bṛhaddeśī* (c. 6th–8th c. CE), carries the same
--   gamut into the deśī repertoire.
--
--   The technical fact this file takes from the procedure, and only this:
--   the experiment is run with TWO instruments.  A single vīṇā, however
--   long it is played, cannot report its own displacement; what reports it
--   is a second instrument holding the un-displaced state, read position
--   by position.  The theorems below are that statement, made exact.
--
-- WHAT IS CLAIMED OF THE SOURCE.
--   That the *Nāṭyaśāstra*'s procedure requires a second, held instrument
--   and a per-position comparison, and that the text records the counts of
--   coincidences rather than an aggregate.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED OF THE SOURCE.
--   * NOT that any of these texts states any theorem below.  The formal
--     content here is ordinary finite combinatorics; the texts are the
--     apparatus, not the proof.
--   * NOT that the 22 śrutis are equal steps of a cyclic group.  They are
--     not equal — 4-3-2-4-4-3-2 has three distinct step sizes — and the
--     equal-step reading is a modern idealisation.  The cyclic gamut in
--     this file is `p = 24`, which is NOT a śruti count; it is the
--     template cycle of the corpus artifact analysed below.  The gamut of
--     the source and the gamut of the theorem are deliberately different
--     numbers so that no reader mistakes one for the other.
--   * NOT that the fourfold sāraṇā is a counting argument.  It is a
--     listening procedure that settles a numerical question.
--
-- PRIOR ART IN THIS REPOSITORY, checked before writing (grep on TEXT names,
-- not author names, per CLAUDE.md):
--   `NaturalMachine.ApavadaVisaya_TheLineWorldCorollaryPinsItsObservableUpToScalar`
--   and collab/messages/2041 (cf-tessera-2) already carry the *Nāṭyaśāstra*,
--   the *Saṅgītaratnākara* and the sāraṇā under the **gcd law**: which
--   chains of a fixed interval close early and which exhaust the cycle.
--   That is the ORBIT question.  This file is the VISIT-COUNT question,
--   which is disjoint from it: how often each position is struck in `n`
--   steps, and what a readout of that data does and does not determine.
--   `notes/SEED78_THE_CYCLOTOMIC_COMMA.md` carries the Pythagorean comma as
--   an exact lattice residue; nothing here touches it.

-- THE TWO METHOD LENSES, AND WHICH ONE THIS FILE DECIDES FOR.
--
--   Darwin — variation plus selection plus time explains the appearance of
--   design.  Ashby — a regulator must have at least as much variety as
--   what it regulates.  On the drawn material the two disagree, and the
--   disagreement is sharp on `machine/race-variants.sh`, whose own footer
--   prints "PRIMARY METRIC DID NOT SEPARATE THE VARIANTS" and, separately,
--   that the kernel gate "certifies by `refl` over {0, s, +, *} only".
--   Darwin's lens reads a flat table as a shortage of variation or of
--   time, and prescribes more variants and more rounds.  Ashby's lens says
--   the prescription cannot work: the SELECTOR's output has variety one
--   (every arm scores known=0), and a one-valued readout regulates nothing
--   however rich the thing being read.  `sarana-total` is that objection
--   made into a theorem — the aggregate is invariant under the
--   displacement FOR EVERY `n`, so no budget of steps makes it informative
--   — and `readout-separates` is the matching positive half: the labelled,
--   per-position readout does see the displacement.  Ashby wins here.

-- 1.  THE GAMUT.
--
-- A gamut is a nonempty cyclic list of counters.  The HEAD is the position
-- currently under the hand; the tail runs upward through the cycle and
-- wraps.  Nonemptiness is structural — `ℕ × List ℕ`, not `List ℕ` — so
-- that striking the current position can never silently miss, which is the
-- side condition an index-plus-vector encoding would have to carry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2.  THE AGGREGATE IS BLIND.
--
-- Displacement leaves the aggregate exactly fixed, and a strike raises it
-- by exactly one, wherever the hand happens to be.  Hence after `n` draws
-- the aggregate is `n` plus its initial value AND NOTHING ELSE: it is a
-- function of `n` alone, with no dependence on the starting phase.

-- COROLLARY (Ashby, exact form).  Two walks of the same length over the
-- same gamut, started at ANY two phases, have the same aggregate.  A
-- regulator whose readout is `total` has variety one over the phase set,
-- so it cannot distinguish any displacement, at any budget `n`.

-- 3.  THE LABELLED READOUT IS NOT BLIND.
--
-- The concrete instance is the EGB field book: p = 24 template positions,
-- n = 450 numbered diamonds.  450 = 18·24 + 18.
--
-- To read a finished walk at position 0 the gamut must be realigned so the
-- head is position 0 again.  Total displacements must be a multiple of 24:
-- phase 0 walk uses 0 + 450 + 30 = 480 = 20·24, phase 1 uses
-- 1 + 450 + 29 = 480.  Realignment is `calana`, which strikes nothing.

-- 4.  THE REFUTATION.  Stated as a claim I formed and then killed.
--
-- CLAIM (mine, on first reading the JSON):  `template_counts` is fully
-- determined by the two numbers already in the same record, 450 and 24.
-- The reverification therefore returns zero information, and reparsing
-- 312254 bytes to obtain it is arithmetic performed as measurement.
--
-- REFUTATION.  False, and `readout-separates` is the check that kills it.
-- The count vector is determined by (n, p, PHASE), not by (n, p).  The
-- MULTISET of counts is phase-invariant — it is {19 eighteen times,
-- 18 six times} for both walks above — but the count vector as a labelled
-- function of position is not: at position 0 it reads 19 at phase 0 and 18
-- at phase 1.  Since 0 < 450 mod 24 < 24, the vector pins the phase
-- exactly.  So the field carries log₂ 24 bits that (450, 24) does not.
--
-- What survives of the claim, restated so it is true: the reverification
-- returns log₂ 24 ≈ 4.58 bits about the artifact's phase, out of the
-- 450 · log₂ 24 ≈ 2064 bits its 450 template choices could in principle
-- have carried.  Nearly vacuous is not vacuous, and the difference is the
-- whole of what a labelled readout buys over an aggregate one — which is
-- the theorem, not an aside.
--
-- The generalisation is left OPEN and is not claimed here: that for every
-- n, p with 0 < n mod p < p the labelled count vector determines the phase
-- uniquely.  Two instances and a mechanism are two instances and a
-- mechanism.
