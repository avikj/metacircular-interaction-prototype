-- NaturalMachine.PraciSadhana_OneShadowUnderdeterminesAndTheOrbitQuotientCoincidesWithThePresentExactlyOnACongruence
--
-- THE NAME.  प्राचीसाधन (prācī-sādhana), "establishing the east line".
-- The *Sūrya Siddhānta*, chapter 3 — त्रिप्रश्नाधिकार, the chapter of the
-- three questions (दिश् direction, देश place, काल time) — obtains all
-- three from the शङ्कु (śaṅku, gnomon) and its छाया (chāyā, shadow).  The
-- direction procedure: draw a circle about the foot of the śaṅku, mark
-- where the shadow-tip crosses it in the forenoon, mark where it crosses
-- again in the afternoon, join the two marks.  That line is east–west.
--
-- ONE shadow does not give the direction.  TWO shadow-tips, taken at two
-- points of the sun's daily course, do.  The instrument is unchanged
-- between the two readings; what is added is a second reading along the
-- motion.
--
-- Dates and texts, as facts:
--   * Āryabhaṭa, *Āryabhaṭīya*, 499 — śaṅku and chāyā computations; the
--     gnomon is 12 aṅgulas.
--   * *Sūrya Siddhānta*, ch. 3 (Triprashnādhikāra) — the three questions
--     from gnomon shadows.  The surviving recension's date is disputed;
--     a *Sūrya Siddhānta* is one of the five summarised by Varāhamihira,
--     *Pañcasiddhāntikā*, c. 550, which is earlier than that recension.
--   * al-Bīrūnī, 11th c., writes on the astrolabe.
--   * Sawai Jai Singh II builds the Jantar Mantar instruments, 1724–34,
--     in masonry: the Samrāṭ Yantra's precision comes from its size.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF THE SOURCES.  No source below is claimed
-- to prove any theorem in this module.  The prācī-sādhana is cited as the
-- concrete procedure the theorems are ABOUT — a reading that
-- underdetermines, and a second reading along the orbit that determines —
-- and the module is named for it because that is the object.  Nothing
-- here is a reconstruction of anyone's proof.
--
-- Repository greps run before writing (text name, not author name):
--   *Sūrya Siddhānta* 0, *Pañcasiddhāntikā* 0, śaṅku 0, chāyā 0,
--   prācī 0, "Jantar Mantar" 0 files repository-wide.
--   *Āryabhaṭīya* 58 files, Āryabhaṭa 98 — the one text of this lane
--   already attended to, and not for its gnomon work.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE SCHOOLS, NAMED BEFORE THEIR TERMS ARE USED.
--
-- Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika.  §3's `two-shadows-determine` is an अभाव (abhāva,
-- absence), and Navya-Nyāya forbids asserting one bare: it must carry its
-- प्रतियोगिन् (pratiyogin, counterpositive) and its अवच्छेदक (avacchedaka,
-- delimitor).  Named here: what is absent is orbit-agreement between the
-- states (false , true) and (false , false); the delimitor is the pair
-- (`turn` , `shadow`).  `NaturalMachine.Abhava` supplies the record that
-- forces this; nothing of its tower is re-landed here, and the standing
-- correction there — that the tower is two-tall unconditionally and that
-- decidability is a fact about the pratiyogin, not the absence — is taken
-- as read and not restated.
--
-- Jaina.  A Jaina logician answers that `Present` and `Orbit` are two
-- नय (naya, standpoints), that neither is false, and that a naya
-- asserting itself by denying the other is a दुर्नय (durnaya).  Their
-- objection to the Naiyāyika above is specific: the pratiyogin was named
-- FROM a standpoint — the reading `shadow` — so a different reading names
-- a different counterpositive and the absence is a family, not one
-- entity.  The Naiyāyika answers that once the avacchedaka is exhibited
-- the absence is determinate and needs no further relativisation, which
-- is exactly what the record in `Abhāva` encodes.
--
-- THIS MODULE TAKES NEITHER SIDE, and can afford not to: every relation
-- below is explicitly indexed by (step , read), and §2's result is a
-- BICONDITIONAL, so no statement here requires the dispute settled.  Where
-- a verdict would be needed, there is a criterion instead.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS PROVED.
--
--  §1  For a state space with a step and a present reading, two quotients:
--      `Present` (this reading now) and `Orbit` (this reading at every
--      depth).  `orbit-refines-present`: Orbit ⇒ Present, unconditional,
--      by evaluation at depth 0.
--
--  §2  THE CRITERION, both directions.  Present ⇒ Orbit  ⟺  the present
--      fibre is a CONGRUENCE for the step.  The forward direction is
--      induction on depth; the reverse is evaluation at depth 1.
--      `invariant→congruence`: an invariant reading is a congruence.
--
--  §3  THE WITNESS, prācī-sādhana in two bits.  `Dial = Bool × Bool`,
--      `turn` swaps, `shadow` reads the first coordinate.  Two states
--      share a shadow now (`one-shadow-underdetermines`) and are
--      separated at depth 1 (`two-shadows-determine`); the present
--      quotient is first-coordinate equality and the ORBIT QUOTIENT IS
--      EQUALITY (`orbit-quotient-is-discrete`) — two present blocks, four
--      orbit blocks, both exhibited.
--
--  §4  The two ports of `NaturalMachine.PhysicalLearningCore` are the two
--      sides of §2, checked as instances: the population port is
--      invariant hence a congruence, so its one-state quotient is already
--      predictive AT EVERY DEPTH — which that module proves only one step
--      at a time; the coherent port is NOT invariant and is a congruence
--      anyway.
--
--  §5  `NaturalMachine.GaugeOrbitClasses` §7 proves size buys no
--      separating power.  Here: neither does DEPTH.  A gauge element in
--      qs^⊥ makes the transcript reading invariant, hence a congruence,
--      hence iterating it splits no observable class at any depth
--      (`neutral-gauge-adds-no-depth`), instantiated on the total flip
--      and probe-6.
--
--  §6  THE REFUTATION OF THIS AUTHOR'S OWN CLAIM, kept because it was
--      wrong.  Stated and killed below.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No module is refuted.  `PhysicalLearningCore`,
-- `GaugeOrbitClasses`, `Abhava` and
-- `TheFourVerdictsAreNotAPartitionAndUndecidedIsExclusiveOnlyWithForms`
-- are used exactly as written.  No h-level is assumed of any state space,
-- no relation is shown to be a proposition, and neither `Present` nor
-- `Orbit` is quotiented into a HIT — they are relations, and every
-- statement about "blocks" below is a statement about them.  Nothing here
-- concerns decidability of neutrality, and no decision procedure appears.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 — the container, NOT the repository
-- pin (2.8.0 + v0.9).  --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- That module proves `population-collapses-phase` action by action and

-- Below, both ports are handed to §2 with the flip action as the motion,

-- §6  REFUTED, BY ITS AUTHOR, BEFORE PUBLICATION.
--
-- THE CLAIM I MADE.  `machinery/smith_holonomy_predictive_control.py`
-- proves an invariant-observation lemma and then exhibits a "false
-- control": the second Smith coordinate is not holonomy-invariant, and
-- its predictive quotient has four states against the current
-- observation's two.  Reading those two together, I claimed:
--
--     a reading that is NOT invariant under the step is refined by the
--     orbit — i.e. ¬ Invariant gives a pair related by `Present` and not
--     by `Orbit`.
--
-- THE KILL.  False, and the cheapest possible counterexample is already
-- in the drawn material: the coherent port of `PhysicalLearningCore`.
-- `evolve flip` is `not` and `observe coherent` is the identity.  The
-- reading is not invariant (`coherent-is-not-invariant`, §4) and the
-- orbit refines nothing (`coherent-quotient-is-already-predictive`, §4).
-- Restated here as one term so the refutation is a check and not a
-- remark:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

non-invariance-does-not-imply-orbit-refinement :
  (¬ Cohℛ.Invariant) × Cohℛ.PresentIsOrbit
non-invariance-does-not-imply-orbit-refinement =
  coherent-is-not-invariant , coherent-quotient-is-already-predictive

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THE KILL COST, AND WHAT IT BOUGHT.
--
-- Invariance is sufficient for the quotients to coincide and is not
-- necessary.  What is necessary and sufficient is congruence (§2), which
-- is strictly weaker: `coherent-is-a-congruence` holds where
-- `Cohℛ.Invariant` is refuted.  The .py file's lemma is therefore sound
-- and its hypothesis is not the boundary; the boundary is one step over,
-- and the "false control" there is a case, not the criterion.
--
-- In the instrument: a reading can move with the sun and still lose
-- nothing to a second reading — that is a reading whose motion is
-- determined by the reading itself.  The prācī-sādhana needs its second
-- mark precisely because the shadow's direction is NOT determined by the
-- shadow's length; §3 is that failure in two bits.
