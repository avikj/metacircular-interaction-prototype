-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

--
-- `machine/QuestionMachine.hs` opens by saying "Agda holds the theorems;
-- this holds the run. Every function here has a checked counterpart …
-- Nothing is measured: the output is a replay of statements that are
-- already proved."  One of its functions is not a replay, and the two
-- halves of why are proved here.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT I READ, AND WHAT IT SHOWED
--
-- `NaturalMachine.KFlow`, signatures and proof bodies:
--
--   Contracting f = (n : ℕ) → 0 < n → f n < n
--   decay      : (f) → Contracting f → (n) → Σ[ k ] iterate f k n ≡ 0
--   Stationary f n = f n ≡ n
--   resonance  : (f) (n) → Stationary f n → (k) → iterate f k n ≡ n
--
-- Every one of those is conditional on a GLOBAL property of `f`.  The
-- shelf's `flowVerdict` takes no such hypothesis: it computes 64 iterates
-- and branches on two finite tests, `any (== 0)` and `and (zipWith (==)
-- xs (drop 1 xs))`, with "branching" as the catch-all.  So it is not a
-- replay of `KFlow`; it is a finite approximation of a statement `KFlow`
-- proves under hypotheses the run cannot check.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE TWO HALVES, AND THEY GO OPPOSITE WAYS
--
-- §1  RESONANCE: one comparison decides it.  `Stationary f n` is
--     literally `iterate f 1 n ≡ n`, so the test is sound AND complete,
--     and 63 of the shelf's 64 comparisons are redundant.  (`KFlow`
--     already proves the forward direction; the converse is what makes
--     the finite test legitimate and is what is added here.)
--
-- §2  DECAY: no prefix decides it.  For EVERY prefix length N there is a
--     contracting `f` and a start whose orbit is nowhere 0 within N and
--     is 0 at N+1.  So `any (== 0)` over a prefix is sound and
--     INCOMPLETE, and the "otherwise ⟹ branching" catch-all is unsound:
--     the same witness is labelled branching while it decays.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No criticism of `KFlow`, which proves exactly
-- what it states.  No claim that the shelf's other functions fail to be
-- replays — I checked this one.  No claim about ρ, spectral radius, or
-- any quantity the trichotomy is named for; `Contracting`, `Stationary`
-- and `Expanding` are the hypotheses actually in play, and ρ appears
-- nowhere below.
--
-- CHECKED on the CONTAINER (Agda 2.6.3, cubical v0.5 — NOT the declared
-- pin, Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9).  --safe, no postulates, no holes.

-- 3.  What the two halves say together
--
-- The finite resonance test is exact — and 63 of the shelf's 64
-- comparisons buy nothing, because `f n ≡ n` already gives the orbit.
-- The finite decay test is sound and incomplete at every length, so the
-- branch that fires when it fails cannot be "branching": failure to see
-- a zero within N is compatible with a contracting map.
--
-- The repair is not a bigger prefix.  §2 is quantified over N, so no
-- constant fixes it; what fixes it is checking the HYPOTHESIS `KFlow`
-- actually assumes — `Contracting f` — which `decIsContracting`
-- discharges in one line for this witness.  A run cannot check that for
-- an arbitrary `f`, which is the honest reason the shelf's verdict is a
-- report and not a replay.
