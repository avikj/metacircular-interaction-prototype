-- Source: `notes/SELECTION_RETAINS_WHAT_VALUE_FORGETS.md` §§5.1–5.5
-- (build queue `notes/D0026_BUILD_QUEUE.md` §4b item Q10; D0026 §2.9,
-- owner Delta 30,
-- `collab/upstream/raw/D0026-owner-egb-core-transmission-v2-2026-08-16.md`).
-- §5.5 of that note specifies this module and explicitly does not claim
-- to have written or checked it; this file is that authorship.
--
-- THE POINT OF THE MODULE, stated before any code.
--
--   On the four pure profiles 𝒜 = {H,T}² of matching pennies, three
--   summary maps are available:
--
--     * social welfare  W = u₁ + u₂         — ONE fiber (constant);
--     * the pure-Nash predicate  pne        — ONE fiber (constant false,
--                                             because no pure profile is
--                                             an equilibrium);
--     * the best-response composite β₂ ∘ π₁ — TWO fibers.
--
--   By the corpus's level-set theorem (T)
--   (`notes/OBSERVABLE_DESCENT_COMMON_OBJECT.md` §1: f factors through q
--   iff f is constant on every q-fiber), a summary with a SINGLE fiber
--   forces every map factoring through it to be constant.  Hence the
--   best-response structure descends through NEITHER W NOR pne.  That is
--   the whole separator, and it is (T) again — not a new theorem, a
--   fourth costume for an old one.
--
--   Consequently, and this is the finding the source note was written
--   for: `VERIFIER_BLIND_FIBER_REWARD` Theorem A (a reward that is a
--   function of a one-fiber observable carries zero bits about position
--   inside the fiber) and von Neumann's oldest game example ARE THE SAME
--   THEOREM.  One is a number-theoretic witness for it, the other a
--   strategic one.  `VERIFIER_BLIND_FIBER_REWARD`'s Theorem A and this
--   module's `separator-W` / `separator-pne` are two instantiations of
--   (T) at different q.
--
-- NORMALIZATION (source note §5.5).  The textbook payoffs are ±1, which
-- would drag in ℤ.  Best responses are invariant under a PER-PLAYER
-- positive affine map, so apply x ↦ (x+1)/2 to each player separately:
--
--     u₁(a,b) = [a = b] ∈ {0,1},   u₂ = 1 − u₁.
--
--   β₁ and β₂ are unchanged by construction; W ≡ 1 replaces W ≡ 0.  The
--   constancy of W — the only thing §5.2 uses — survives verbatim, and
--   everything below is decidable on Bool with ℕ-valued payoffs in
--   {0,1}: no Int, no Rationals, no order-completeness.  H := true,
--   T := false.
--
-- CONTENTS
--
--   §1  u₁ u₂ W          the normalized payoffs (4 clauses each) and
--                        `welfare-const`, §5.2: W ≡ 1 by four refls.
--   §2  β₁-best β₂-best  §5.3's best-response maps β₁ = id, β₂ = not,
--                        each certified as a genuine maximum over the
--                        deviating player's whole action set (4 clauses
--                        each, every clause an explicit ≤-witness).
--   §3  IsNash           §5.3: no pure profile is Nash.  Four clauses,
--       no-pure-nash     each discharged by the deviation named in the
--                        best-response 4-cycle, and each reducing to the
--                        SAME refutation ¬ (1 ≤ 0).
--   §4  pne              the Boolean pure-Nash test read off β₁, β₂; its
--                        constancy by four refls.
--   §5  one-fiber-       theorem (T) in its degenerate one-fiber form,
--       forces-constant  proved generally (no case split), then
--       separator-W      applied to W and to pne against
--       separator-pne    β = β₂ ∘ π₁, whose two fibers are exhibited by
--                        `β-surjective`.
--
-- RIGOR BOUNDARY — what is checked here, and what deliberately is not.
--
--   CHECKED.  Every statement of §§5.2–5.4 of the source note, as exact
--   finite computation on Bool with ℕ payoffs in {0,1}: the constancy of
--   W; that β₁ = id and β₂ = not really are best responses (a maximum
--   over the full action set, not an assertion); the emptiness of the
--   pure-Nash set; the constancy of the Boolean Nash test; the
--   two-valuedness of β₂ ∘ π₁; and the two non-factorization statements
--   that are Theorem 5.1.  `one-fiber-forces-constant` is proved for
--   ARBITRARY codomains, so the separator is the general lemma applied,
--   not a coincidence of Bool.
--
--   NOT CHECKED, ON PURPOSE.
--    (a) The bridge `pne p ≡ true ↔ IsNash (fst p) (snd p)`.  §5.3
--        derives it from single-valuedness of the best responses; here
--        the two objects are established INDEPENDENTLY — `no-pure-nash`
--        at the type level, `pne-const` at the Boolean level — and
--        neither is used to prove the other.  Nothing below depends on
--        the bridge; a reader who wants it must prove it.
--    (b) Mixed strategies.  Remark 5.4 of the source note (the minimax
--        value 0 attained at the uniform pair) is QUOTED there from
--        `D0020_CLASSICAL_SOURCES` row 4.13 and is not derived; it is
--        absent here for the same reason.  Nothing in this module says
--        anything about mixed extensions, existence of equilibria, or
--        the value of the game.
--    (c) The Candogan–Menache–Ozdaglar–Parrilo harmonic/potential
--        decomposition (source note Remark 5.5): matching pennies is the
--        canonical harmonic game, the repo has potential games at
--        EGB_LIBRARY_INDEX 202–205, and the connection is open in the
--        note and open here.
--    (d) The lens category laws of the source note's Theorem 2.3, which
--        §5.5 says are likewise refl and belong in a SIBLING module.
--        They are not here.
--
--   Nothing in this file is measured, fitted, or floating-point.  Every
--   number is an element of a two-element subset of ℕ and every
--   comparison is a kernel reduction — the exact/certified symbolic
--   computation CLAUDE.md licenses unconditionally.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, no TERMINATING, no primTrustMe.
