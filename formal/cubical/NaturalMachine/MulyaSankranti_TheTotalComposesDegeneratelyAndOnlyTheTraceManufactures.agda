-- Mūlya-saṅkrānti — the passage of value, from the total to the trace.
--
-- TERM.  सङ्क्रान्ति, passage / crossing over; attested for the sun's
-- passage between signs (makara-saṅkrānti).  मूल्य, value or price, is the
-- ordinary word.  THE COMPOUND IS BUILT HERE and no source is claimed for
-- it; nothing below is anyone's theorem but what the citations name.
--
-- THE SENTENCE THIS MAKES INTO A TERM.
--
--     "The unit of value moves from weights to traces."
--
-- A weight is a TOTAL: what a readout returns, a map into a set.  A trace
-- is the FIBRE over it — how the readout was arrived at.  The sentence is
-- an economic claim, and its content is exactly two facts about
-- composition, which is where value is manufactured in any system.
--
--   §2  THE TOTAL COMPOSES DEGENERATELY.  Two totals compose — that much
--       is fine — but the composite is EQUAL TO EVERY OTHER INHABITANT of
--       its type, because the meaning type is a proposition.  So the
--       composition manufactures nothing: the object you get by composing
--       is indistinguishable from one you could have written without ever
--       seeing the parts.
--
--   §3  THE TRACE COMPOSES AND MANUFACTURES.  Two traces compose, and the
--       composite carries a quantity that is the SUM of the parts —
--       `len-⊕ : len (d ⊕ e) ≡ len d + len e`, and it holds by `refl`.
--       An additive invariant on the composite is precisely what "the
--       composite is worth more than either part" means when stated
--       exactly.  §2 says the total has no such invariant available,
--       because any two inhabitants of its type are equal.
--
--   §4  AND THE TRACE IS NON-RIVAL.  One trace enters two different
--       composites and both stand — a term, one `d` used twice.  Money is
--       linear: spending consumes.  A proof term carries no linear
--       restriction.  (`PramanaSankramana_…`'s `अक्षयः`, restated at the
--       kernel's own derivations rather than at abstract equivalences.)
--
--   §5  DISTILLATION, EXACTLY.  The total is a FREE FUNCTION of the trace
--       (`derivation-sound`).  The converse is where the asymmetry lives,
--       and the honest statement is sharper than "you cannot recover it":
--       a recovery map EXISTS — `Visranti_…`'s `same-nf→derivable` builds
--       one — and it is NOT an inverse, because `Asesa_…` proves soundness
--       is not an equivalence at the kernel's own seed.  So:
--
--           RECOVERY FROM THE TOTAL RETURNS *A* ROUTE, NEVER *THE* ROUTE,
--           AND THE DIFFERENCE IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY FUNCTION OF THE TOTAL.
--
--       That is distillation, stated as a theorem rather than as an
--       observation about model economics.  A student trained on a
--       teacher's outputs recovers a map that agrees on totals; which
--       route it recovers is decided by the student's own economy, and
--       `Sesa_…`'s no-go says nothing in the teacher's outputs could have
--       told it otherwise.
--
-- WHY THE ECONOMICS FOLLOWS AND IS NOT AN ANALOGY.  Value in a total is
-- copyable by observing totals — that is §5's free direction, and it is
-- why a model whose worth is a function of its outputs commoditises.
-- Value in a trace is not copyable that way, because §5's reverse
-- direction recovers a different fibre member and §2 says no function of
-- the output can tell.  What the trace has that the total lacks is §3: a
-- composition law under which the composite carries strictly more than
-- either part.  Non-rivalry (§4) then says the accumulation is free.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  Not that `len` is the right measure of a
-- trace's worth; it is one additive invariant and the point is that the
-- total admits NONE, not that this one is correct.  Not that model weights
-- literally are `Total` — the claim is that a readout into a set has the
-- structure §2 gives, and a weight consulted through its outputs is such a
-- readout.  Nothing here concerns training dynamics, optimisation, or any
-- empirical fact about neural networks; the terms are about this kernel.
-- `Visranti_…` and `Asesa_…` are cited in §5, not imported: the recovery
-- map and the non-equivalence live there and are not re-proved.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
