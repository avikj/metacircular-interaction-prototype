-- Ākāṅkṣā — the pattern's demand, and what soundness does to it.
--
-- TERM.  आकाङ्क्षा, expectancy: in the Indian accounts of how uttered words
-- yield one cognition (śābdabodha) it is the first of the conditions — a
-- word EXPECTS its complements, and an utterance leaving an expectancy
-- unsatisfied does not compose.  The triad ākāṅkṣā / yogyatā / āsatti is
-- common to Mīmāṃsā and Nyāya and is developed at length in the later
-- Nyāya (Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, 14th c.).  GRADE OF THE CITATION,
-- stated because an unchecked provenance is the same class of error as a
-- fitted constant: the doctrine and the school are what I can establish; I
-- have NOT verified any chapter or sūtra against an edition, so none is
-- given.  Nothing below is anyone's theorem and no author is claimed to
-- have written about substitution in a rewrite calculus.  The word names
-- the phenomenon: a rule whose sthānin does not bind the variable has no
-- expectancy to satisfy, and the question is what its ādeśa may then say.
--
-- WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS.  `Vyapti_…` repairs the kernel's memorisation by
-- giving an operation a schematic control,
--
--     Control t = Σ[ u ∈ Tm ] (t ≡ subVar u lhs)      and
--     apply t (u , _) = subVar u rhs .
--
-- That is the first operation in the corpus whose EMISSION READS ITS
-- EVIDENCE — every `install`ed operation has `apply _ _ = target`, a
-- constant.  As soon as an emission reads its evidence, a question arises
-- that a constant emission cannot pose:
--
--     IF TWO DIFFERENT CONTROLS ARE ADMISSIBLE AT ONE TERM, THE OPERATION
--     EMITS TWO DIFFERENT TERMS FROM ONE CONTEXT.
--
-- Nothing in the corpus ruled that out, and `apply-sound` is proved for
-- EVERY control, so both emissions would carry proofs: a generator with two
-- distinct certified outputs at one context.  That is `Sesa_…`'s semantic
-- statement (correctness does not select) arriving operationally.
--
-- The failure shape is not hypothetical outside the kernel.  Ask the
-- corpus's Pāṇinian interface for the class `yaṆ` and it does not answer
-- with a class: the anubandha ṇ occurs twice in the fourteen śivasūtras
-- (sūtras 1 and 6), so the two-letter name denotes only once an OCCURRENCE
-- INDEX is supplied, and the running sabhā takes that index (`avrtti`) as a
-- parameter rather than guessing.  A name needing a disambiguating index is
-- exactly a control that fails to determine its emission.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED.  The kernel cannot host one.  Two reasons, exhaustive:
--
--   §3  MOVING PATTERNS PIN THEIR WITNESS.  If `var` occurs in `lhs` at all
--       (`deg lhs ≡ nsuc j`) then `subVar a lhs ≡ subVar b lhs → a ≡ b`, so
--       the witness is unique and the emission is determined.  Purely
--       syntactic — no semantics is used.
--
--   §5  RIGID PATTERNS CANNOT PASS THE VARIABLE ON, AND THIS IS WHERE
--       SOUNDNESS IS NEEDED.  If `var` does not occur in `lhs`, every `a`
--       is admissible and §3 is unavailable.  But a schema also carries
--       `meaning : (ρ : Env) → eval lhs ρ ≡ eval rhs ρ`, and in this
--       calculus raising x by one raises a term's value by EXACTLY its
--       degree (§4, `eval-step`).  A rigid `lhs` is therefore constant
--       along x; a sound `rhs` must be too; hence `deg rhs ≡ nzero`, and
--       then `subVar a rhs ≡ rhs` for every `a`.
--
--   §6  EVERY SOUND SCHEMA IS DETERMINISTIC.  At any term, any two
--       admissible controls emit the same term.  Not by a well-formedness
--       side condition anyone imposed — by meaning-preservation alone.
--
-- READ AS GRAMMAR: an ādeśa may not introduce material its sthānin did not
-- bind, and that is not a stipulation of the metalanguage — it follows from
-- the rule being meaning-preserving at every environment.
--
-- READ AS SEMANTICS OF PROGRAMS: a sequential algorithm in the sense of
-- Kahn–Plotkin and Berry–Curien is a function together with a computation
-- strategy, and its output must be determined by the cells it queried.  §6
-- says every sound schema here satisfies that without being asked to: the
-- pattern is the query, and soundness makes the query sufficient.  Named as
-- the frame this speaks to; nothing below is a theorem of theirs and no
-- concrete data structure appears.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED.  Nothing about the OPEN interface: an arbitrary
-- caller-supplied `Control` may still be inhabited many ways, and
-- `Vyapti_.enabled-set-is-subsingleton` bounds WHERE an operation fires,
-- not how many ways it may be witnessed.  This is about the schematic
-- control only.  §3 says a witness is unique, not that one can be found —
-- nothing here decides matching.  `deg` counts `var` alone, because
-- `subVar` replaces `var` alone; the six-coordinate schema (the corpus's
-- open frontier item) is NOT covered — §4 would need redoing for it.
-- `Vyapti_…` is not imported: the statement is given on raw `lhs`, `rhs`
-- and `meaning`, which is what its record holds.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  CHECKED this session, EXIT 0, at
-- Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 -- which is NOT the corpus pin (2.8.0 +
-- v0.9).  Re-check at the pin before treating this green as the lane's.
