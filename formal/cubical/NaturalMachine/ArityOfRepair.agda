-- ArityOfRepair
--
-- The DELTA on NaturalMachine.FillabilityCertificate, for
-- notes/FILLABILITY_AS_SUCCESS.md (seed 177).
--
-- That module formalises the note's §2–§4: the two fillability
-- predicates, their strict separation (A∞), the decision procedure that
-- consumes finite branching, and Theorem 4.1's truncation bound.  It
-- does NOT touch the note's §5, which the note itself calls its
-- classification finding:
--
--     Theorem 5.3.  The dividing line for quantitative defects is NOT
--     "presupposes an attainable distinguished zero" (Thm A) but the
--     ARITY of the repair certificate (Thm B).  Γ⇑ escapes Thm A —
--     its success predicate Fill_∞ presupposes no zero — and is still
--     caught by Thm B, whose proof uses only unarity.
--
-- This module makes that a typing fact.  The whole point is that the
-- impossibility is visible in the SIGNATURE of the operator: the
-- refuted objects below mention no zero, no distinguished element, no
-- FillSys and no tower.  They mention an arity and an input type.
--
-- HEADLINE STATEMENTS (all checked, no postulates, no holes, --safe):
--
--  1. Bounds / Certifies / Tight / pinned
--                       A repair certificate for a QUANTITATIVE defect
--                       is bilateral: a pair (lo , hi) with
--                       lo ≤ δ ≤ hi (the note's C₋ ⪯ δ ⪯ C₊,
--                       §5.2).  `pinned` proves the elementary fact
--                       that a tight bilateral certificate DETERMINES
--                       the magnitude — which is why unarity bites.
--
--  2. unary-lower-always
--                       One side is free: every slot admits a unary
--                       lower bound (lo := 0).  This is Theorem B's
--                       "at most one of C₊, C₋", positive half, and it
--                       is what stops the negative below from being a
--                       triviality about functions.
--
--  3. no-unary-bilateral
--                       Theorem B, formalised.  If the structural
--                       presentation is AMBIGUOUS — two data with the
--                       same presentation and different magnitudes —
--                       then no operation whose only input is that
--                       presentation is sound and tight.  The proof is
--                       four steps and uses nothing about zeros.
--
--  4. no-nary-bilateral
--                       Arity within the same input type never helps:
--                       for every n, an n-ary operation on structural
--                       presentations is refuted, because the certificate
--                       for a single datum has only that datum to be
--                       computed from (diagonal application).  `Ar` makes
--                       the arity an explicit index of the type.
--
--  5. binary-heterogeneous-works
--                       …and the dividing line really is arity, not
--                       impossibility: a BINARY operation taking the
--                       presentation together with a construction is
--                       sound and tight, exhibited.
--
--  6. second-argument-separates
--                       The note's slogan, as a theorem: "the filler
--                       would have to be the proof" (§5.2).  ANY correct
--                       binary operation's second argument must already
--                       distinguish the ambiguous pair — so the second
--                       input is not coherence data, it carries the whole
--                       content of the missing bound.
--
--  7. tower-readout-caught
--                       Obstruction 1 of §5.2, for Γ⇑ specifically and
--                       for any successor mode: whatever tower type T an
--                       operation on structural data produces, and
--                       whatever readout T → Bounds is applied to it, the
--                       composite is a unary operation on presentations
--                       and is refuted by 3.  T is universally
--                       quantified — nothing about towers is used.
--
--  8. arity-not-zero    Theorem 5.3 as one term: the A∞ system of
--                       FillabilityCertificate §5 has a total branch
--                       with NO level ever distinguished (so a Fill_∞
--                       success presupposes no attainable zero, and
--                       Thm A's criterion does not apply to it), AND the
--                       arity obstruction of 3 holds regardless.  The
--                       two components are independent terms; the bundle
--                       is the statement that the second survives the
--                       failure of the first.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT CLAIMED.
--  * Magnitudes are ℕ, ordered by cubical's `_≤_`.  The note's
--    quantitative defects live in ordered sets of reals/asymptotics; ℕ
--    is a faithful carrier for the ARITY argument (which uses only
--    antisymmetry and the existence of a least element) and for nothing
--    else.  No claim is made about real-valued or asymptotic slots
--    beyond the fact that the argument below never inspects the carrier
--    past those two properties.
--  * "Ambiguous" is a HYPOTHESIS, supplied per slot, not a theorem about
--    any particular corpus defect.  §5.2's paradigm (SEED43 §7: a bound
--    C₊ and a construction C₋ that do not meet) is the intended
--    instance, and this module does not formalise it — doing so would
--    require the resolvent estimate, which is not in this corpus.
--    `ambiguousToy` exhibits one ambiguous slot so that 3 is not vacuous.
--  * Nothing here formalises Γ⇑ itself as an operation into towers.  7
--    is stronger than that would be: it quantifies over ALL output types,
--    so it covers Γ⇑ without needing a model of it.
--  * No Σ⁰₁/Π⁰₂/Σ¹₁ statement, no oracle, no model of computation —
--    same scope limit as FillabilityCertificate, and for the same reason.
