-- व्युत्पत्ति — the surface form is a lossy projection of derivation,
-- and meaning rides the derivation, not the surface.
--
-- (vyutpatti: the derivational formation of a word — dhātu, root, plus
-- pratyaya, affix.  Classical vyākaraṇa vocabulary, used for the objects
-- it names; the theorems are this corpus's, not attributed to any text.)
--
-- THE BRIDGE, stated as this machine's own law applied to language.
-- Human language reaches the machine at the SURFACE — strings.  But in
-- the grammatical tradition a word IS its formation: dhātu + affixes,
-- with the meaning composed along the derivation (the kṛt and taddhita
-- pratyayas each carrying their semantic contribution).  That is
-- content-addressing: व्युत्पत्ति is the claim that the word's identity
-- is the hash of its construction — which is this machine's identity
-- law, arrived at from the other end, ~2,500 years earlier.
--
-- The obstruction to the bridge is exactly a fibre: the map
--
--     surface : Derivation → String
--
-- is NOT injective — sandhi and homonymy collapse distinct derivations
-- onto one string.  A pun (śleṣa) is a two-point fibre of `surface`,
-- played deliberately.  So meaning CANNOT factor through the surface
-- (this module's theorem २: any factoring through a surface with a
-- collision forces two different meanings equal — refuted by
-- exhibition), while meaning DOES factor through derivation by
-- construction (theorem १: artha is a fold over the derivation).
--
-- Consequence for the endeavor: the human↔machine bridge cannot be
-- string-to-term; it must be derivation-to-term — carry the vyutpatti,
-- not the spelling.  The Aṣṭādhyāyī engine (machine/Astadhyayi.hs)
-- already holds the lost material alongside the surface (sthānivadbhāva,
-- lopa channels); this module is the abstract statement of WHY that
-- design is forced: recover-from-surface is exactly a section of a map
-- with inhabited multi-point fibres, and no such section exists.
--
-- The concrete witness is kept small and abstract (two derivations, one
-- surface, two arthas); a real Sanskrit śleṣa instantiates it — the
-- classical stock example is the dual reading of `go` (cow / speech /
-- earth in compound contexts) — but no philological claim is made here:
-- the mathematics needs only that ONE collision exists, and the engine's
-- own corpus supplies collisions mechanically (GhanaPatha prints them).
