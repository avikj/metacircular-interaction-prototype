--
-- utsarga / apavāda -- the narrower rule blocks the wider -- as an exact
-- predicate over a guarded rule system, with the theorem
-- `notes/INDIC_FORMAL_TRADITIONS_MAP.md` §1.5 asked for: *which normal
-- form the priority order reaches*, and not a measured contest.
--
-- The Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973, who coined the term reading
-- Pāṇini; Sanders' Proper Inclusion Precedence) selects, among the rules
-- applicable at a point, the one whose domain is contained in all the
-- others.  What is proved about that selector:
--
--   leastUnique     when it decides, it decides uniquely -- two least
--                   applicable guards have the same domain.  This is the
--                   determinism half.
--
--   chainRooted     if the guard domains form an ascending chain, a least
--                   applicable guard exists at every point where anything
--                   applies.  (utsarga/apavāda alone suffices.)
--
--   directedRooted  the general sufficient condition: it is enough that
--                   any two applicable guards have a common applicable
--                   lower bound *in the family*.  This is the repair --
--                   the grammar must state the narrower rule for the
--                   overlap; then the Elsewhere Condition is complete.
--
--   repairedRooted  directedness is strictly weaker than laminarity
--                   ("every two domains disjoint or nested").  A three-rule
--                   system that is Elsewhere-complete everywhere while
--                   still containing a properly crossing pair
--                   (`gAgB-cross`) is exhibited.  So the taxonomy under
--                   which rule-conflict analysers flag an *intersecting*
--                   pair as an anomaly over-flags: a crossing is harmless
--                   whenever the overlap is separately covered.
--
--   noLeastCrossing / noEquivariantTiebreak
--                   the existence half fails, and fails irreparably from
--                   inside.  Two guards that properly cross admit no least
--                   element at the crossing point (`noLeastCrossing`), and
--                   -- the sharper statement -- NO relabelling-invariant
--                   tiebreak can choose between them (`noEquivariantTiebreak`),
--                   because the carrier has an involution that fixes the
--                   disputed point and exchanges the two guards.
--
--                   Hence A 1.4.2 (vipratiṣedhe paraṃ kāryam) is logically
--                   INDEPENDENT of the apavāda principle, on either reading
--                   of it: whether "the later rule wins" (traditional) or
--                   "the rule applying to the right-hand operand wins"
--                   (Rajpopat 2022), the tiebreak must import data --
--                   textual position, or operand position -- that the guard
--                   family does not carry.  The formal content of "must
--                   import data" is failure of equivariance, and that is
--                   what `noEquivariantTiebreak` proves.  This module takes
--                   no side in the Rajpopat dispute; it shows both sides are
--                   answering a question apavāda provably cannot.
--
-- The instance is the ancient one: Ethiopian / Egyptian doubling
-- multiplication.  Its three rules (`stop at zero`, `halve-and-double`,
-- `peel one`) have domains {0} ⊆ evens ⊆ ℕ -- a chain -- so `chainRooted`
-- applies and the dispatch is total and deterministic with no tiebreak
-- whatever (`dispatchZero`, `dispatchEven`, `dispatchOdd`).  The normal
-- form it reaches is the product: `egyCorrect`.
--
-- Note what the chain condition costs.  A rule list sorted narrowest-first
-- needs no metarule at all: first-match-wins already IS the Elsewhere
-- Condition.  Pāṇini's text is not so sorted -- the utsarga is routinely
-- stated before its own apavāda -- which is precisely why the Aṣṭādhyāyī
-- needs 1.4.1/1.4.2 as metarules rather than as an editorial convention.

-- grammarian's actual move: when two rules cross, state a third, narrower
-- rule for the overlap.  Adding the pairwise meets of the guard family
-- (its intersection-closure) is exactly the canonical way to achieve it.
--
-- The theorem is the finite-directedness argument: a finite downward
-- directed nonempty family has a least element.  The induction carries a
-- running candidate and is the mechanised form of "keep composing
-- exceptions".

-- (c) THE no-go.  A tiebreak is a function `sel` that, given two competing

--   pick : it returns one of the two guards it was handed;
--   symm : it depends on the *pair* of rules, not on which argument slot

--          subsets and the point, and nothing else.
--
-- No such `sel` exists.  All three hypotheses are needed, and each is
-- separately satisfiable, so the statement is not vacuous:
--   * drop `equi`: the textual-order tiebreak -- "return whichever of the
--     two is stated earlier in a fixed enumeration of the book" -- has
--     `pick` and `symm`.  This is exactly *para* (A 1.4.2, traditional
--     reading), and the theorem says its content is precisely the
--     arbitrary enumeration, not anything the rules themselves carry.
--   * drop `symm`: `sel g h y = g` has `pick` and `equi`.
--   * drop `pick`: any constant `sel` has `symm` and `equi`.

-- §6  The instance: Ethiopian / Egyptian doubling multiplication
--
-- Three rules on the multiplier:
--
--   Z  a = 0        -- stop
--   D  a even       -- halve a, double b
--   S  otherwise    -- peel one b off and continue
--
-- Their domains are {0} ⊆ evens ⊆ ℕ: a chain.  So `chainRooted` gives a
-- total, deterministic dispatch at every ℕ, with NO tiebreak -- neither
-- para nor position.  The doubling algorithm is thus the (rare) case where
-- utsarga/apavāda is by itself a complete strategy.
