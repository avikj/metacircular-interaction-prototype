-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Memory, charge, symmetry, price,
-- distance, verdict: six readings of the one fibre.  The kernel decides truth;
-- carriers ask and generate.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- DescentLaw
--
-- The one law of the corpus, at its native level.  The Python
-- DescentMachine's `offer` decides, for a FINITE world and one
-- observable, whether the observable is constant on the fibers of the
-- carrier.  This module states what that loop is a shadow of: descent
-- through a carrier is the elimination rule of the set quotient, and
-- the two branches of `offer` are the two universal statements below.
--
--   DESCENDS  is not a checked property but a constructor of the
--             factorization: `descend` (= SetQuotients.rec).
--   COARSEST  the carrier quotient is universal: any factorization
--             agrees with `descend` pointwise (`descend-unique`).
--   FORMS     a splitting witness (x, y related, observable differs)
--             is a proof that NO factorization exists (`forms`) — the
--             machine's split fiber, as an obstruction, over ALL
--             instances at once rather than an enumerated window.
