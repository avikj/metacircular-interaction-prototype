-- अन्यथासिद्धिः — the proposed antecedent is spurious, and the cause is
-- another.
--
-- THE TERM, ITS TEXT AND ITS DATE.  `अन्यथासिद्ध` (anyathāsiddha,
-- "established otherwise") is the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika technical term for a
-- factor that stands next to an effect, is proposed as its कारण, and is
-- excluded — because what it contributes is already accounted for
-- elsewhere.  The doctrine is stated with its fivefold classification
-- (पञ्चविध-अन्यथासिद्धि) in Annaṃbhaṭṭa, *Tarkasaṃgraha* with his own
-- *Dīpikā*, c. 1600 CE, on the कारण section; the notion is Navya-Nyāya and
-- is worked in Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, c. 1325 CE, whose कारणतावाद is
-- where the exclusion tests are argued.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED.  No Naiyāyika is being credited with group
-- cohomology, with univalence, or with any theorem below.  What is claimed
-- is that the term names, exactly, the move this module performs on a
-- machine-generated proposal: `res` was PROPOSED as the inverse of `infl`,
-- it is not one, and the reason it looked like one is that it is the only
-- other canonical map in sight.  It is अन्यथासिद्ध.  The real inverse is a
-- third map, and it is not `res`.
--
-- AND THE SCHOOL IS NAMED BEFORE THE TERM IS USED, per CLAUDE.md: this is
-- Nyāya vocabulary, not Jaina.  A Jaina logician would not describe the
-- situation this way at all — for anekāntavāda the two candidate readings
-- of "the map back" would be two nayas to be indexed and held together,
-- and `Tantujala_…agda` is where this corpus does that.  Nyāya's move here
-- is the opposite one and it is the right one HERE, because the question
-- has a determinate answer: one of the two maps is the inverse and the
-- other provably is not.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS MODULE IS.
--
-- `machine/AnulomaPratiloma_…hs` proposes candidate inverse pairs by
-- matching type signatures inside one module and puts the round trip to
-- the kernel.  On `NaturalMachine.InflationVersusSubgroup` it proposed
--
--     infl : H2 → H4      ⇄      res : H4 → H2
--
-- and the kernel refused it.  This module says what the refusal is worth,
-- in three parts.
--
--   १  THE PAIR IS REFUTED, AND THE HOST ALREADY PROVED WHY.  `res` is
--      identically `k0` (`res-is-zero`, InflationVersusSubgroup §4), so
--      `res ∘ infl` collapses both classes.  §१ below is one line and it
--      cites the host's own theorem.  Restriction to N ≤ ℤ/4 of a class
--      inflated from the quotient is zero: that is the mathematics, and it
--      is the whole point of the module that defined the two maps.
--
--   २  THE EDGE IS NEVERTHELESS REAL.  `infl` IS an equivalence — its
--      inverse is `res⁺`, defined here, which is not `res` and is not
--      restriction along anything.  So the refuted pair licenses no verdict
--      on the types: H2 ≃ H4 holds.  A machine that reported "not an
--      equivalence" from a failed round trip would have reported a falsehood
--      about the objects while reporting a truth about the pair, and those
--      are two different claims.
--
--   ३  THE EDGE CARRIES A GROUP.  H4 = H¹(ℤ/4, ℤ/2) has no operation in
--      the host module.  §३ gives it one, as the transport of the pointwise
--      sum on H2 = H¹(ℤ/2, ℤ/2), together with its associativity, in one
--      `subst` and with no case split on H4 — the `Setubandha_…agda`
--      pattern.  §४ then checks that the transported operation is the
--      pointwise sum of realizations, which is what makes the sentence
--      "inflation is a group isomorphism" true here rather than asserted.

-- १ · THE PROPOSAL IS REFUTED, BY THE HOST'S OWN THEOREM.
--
--     The machine asked for `res (infl c) ≡ c` for every c.  Taking
--     c = kι, `res-is-zero` gives k0, and the host proves k0 ≢ kι.
--
--     Note what is refuted: the PAIR.  Nothing here says anything about
--     whether H2 and H4 are equivalent, and §२ shows they are.

-- २ · THE REAL INVERSE, AND THE EDGE.
--
--     `res⁺` is not restriction.  It is the inverse of inflation, which on
--     this model exists because H¹(N,V) → H¹(G,V) is not the map in play:
--     inflation goes from the QUOTIENT's cohomology, and here the quotient
--     Γ = G/N and the subgroup N happen to be abstractly isomorphic, which
--     is exactly the coincidence that made the machine's signature match
--     fire.  The signature match was right about the arrows and wrong about
--     the maps.

-- ३ · WHAT CROSSES.  H¹(Γ,V) is a group under pointwise addition of

-- ४ · THE TRANSPORTED OPERATION IS THE RIGHT ONE.
--
--     §३ produces an associative operation on H4 by fiat of transport;
--     that alone would be a checkmark and not a causeway.  This is the
--     content: the transported sum realizes as the pointwise sum of the
--     corresponding characters ℤ/4 → ℤ/2.  With §२ that is the statement
--     that inflation is an isomorphism OF GROUPS
--
--         H¹(G/N, V)  ≅  H¹(G, V)
--
--     on this model, and the only case split performed is on H2 (two
--     cases in `+H4-realizes`, via `res⁺`), never on H4's structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ५ · WHAT IS NOT PROVED HERE, stated so nothing is read into it.
--
--   * That inflation is an isomorphism in general.  It is not.  The
--     inflation–restriction sequence is exact at H¹ with cokernel governed
--     by H¹(N,V)^Γ, and on this model that term vanishes because `res` is
--     zero — which is why the isomorphism holds HERE.  Nothing above
--     generalises and the host module's §3 says the same.
--   * That `res` is the wrong map to have defined.  It is the right map;
--     it is the only canonical map attached to a subgroup, and the host
--     module exists to say so.  What is refuted is the machine's proposal
--     that it inverts `infl`.
--   * That the Nyāya doctrine of अन्यथासिद्धि has any formal counterpart
--     below.  The term names the move; the checks are cubical type theory.
