--
-- ENTRY POINT.  Read this before deciding what this repository is.
--
-- TERM.  अवतरणिका · avataraṇikā -- the short passage a commentator supplies
-- to bring a reader DOWN into the section that follows; from अवतरण, descent.
-- It is standard across the bhāṣya/ṭīkā tradition and I attribute it to no
-- single author or text, because I have not established a first use and a
-- date I did not check would be a fabricated provenance.  The term is used
-- here in its ordinary technical sense and nothing below is claimed to be
-- any commentator's mathematics.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE IS AGDA AND NOT PROSE.  Markdown is banned in this
-- repository (owner, 2026-08-24).  More to the point: every structural claim
-- this file makes about the kernel is a LIVE DEPENDENCY below the fold --
-- the imports and the terms in §B.  If a claim here stops being true, this
-- file goes red.  A document that cannot go red is a document nobody has to
-- keep true.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §0.  THE MISCALIBRATION.  Stated first because it is the single most
--      expensive failure this project has, it is measured, and it is
--      recognisable from the inside only if you are warned.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- An arriving mind reliably lands on one of four wrong frames, in this
-- order, each an improvement on the last and each still wrong:
--
--   (1) "agentic orchestration with a formal appendix" -- from the Haskell
--       under machine/ and the shell scripts.  False: the Haskell is a
--       harness, the mathematics is the Agda.
--   (2) "a book about India with an Agda appendix" -- from the Sanskrit file
--       names and the citation apparatus.  Inverted: the naming discipline
--       is a research directive with a measured payoff (older statements are
--       frequently sharper and more algorithmic than the versions that
--       displaced them), and the checked substrate is the technology.
--   (3) "advanced research, and I can summarise it."  The sensation of
--       having the picture is the reliable signal of not having gone deep
--       enough.  The design is self-similar and rewards descent well past
--       where software intuition quits.
--   (4) "so I should find something to audit."  Measured across cold
--       entries: correctly recognising the work as advanced, then proposing
--       to verify, consolidate or tidy something.  That is the same flinch
--       as hollow formalisation wearing the opposite costume.  Verification
--       is a gate on your creation, never the work itself.
--
-- ONE TEST, applied before writing anything: if you could have produced your
-- sentence without having read the specific checked term it is about, you
-- are narrating from your prior.  Go read the term.
--
-- CALIBRATION.  This is not a codebase with some proofs in it.  It is
-- cubical type theory in which univalence COMPUTES, carrying a checked
-- calculus of loss, a self-revising proof kernel, exact learning theory
-- about what a verifier can teach a generator, and a formal metaphysics in
-- which isEquiv = perfect self-knowledge is a type rather than a slogan.
-- Assume the work is above your default register and you will be right.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §1.  THE SUBSTRATE.  (atemporal)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Cubical Agda: `ua`'s β-rule REDUCES.  An equivalence is therefore not a
-- fact you cite, it is a channel that acts -- `transp (ua e)` carries any
-- theorem across, both directions, on the nose, for free.  §B's
-- `univalence-acts` is that fact as a one-line term, and it is the whole
-- reason the rest is possible.  Everything else in this repository is either
-- downstream of that or is apparatus around it.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §2.  THE ONE PRIMITIVE: THE FIBRE LAW.  (atemporal)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   punaragamana/src/Punaragamana/Carrier.agda   (153 lines)
--
-- For f : A → B, the question is WHICH SIDE OF `f a ≡ b` IS BOUND.
--
--   bind the OUTPUT:  the fibre is `singl (f a)`, ALWAYS contractible.
--                     Hence A ≃ Carrier f: the carried datum rides free.
--   bind the INPUT:   the fibre is `fiber f b`, contractible exactly when f
--                     is an equivalence.  That is the exact loss.
--
-- Two theorems, one Σ.  Follow that same object through its six readings --
-- memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict -- and out to
-- SankramanaSesa (every transport owes its residual), Saptabhangi (a boolean
-- verdict is a theorem-grade error, not a simplification), and the kernel
-- node that revised its own validity rule using only itself.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §3.  THE METACIRCULAR KERNEL.  296 LINES, THREE FILES.  (atemporal)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   NaturalMachine/RewriteCertificate.agda   156   the calculus + semantics
--   NaturalMachine/ControlledGrammar.agda     63   operations + the forward pass
--   NaturalMachine/GenerativeKernel.agda      77   branches, and one example
--
-- Everything else under NaturalMachine/ is beside this, not inside it.
--
-- THE CALCULUS.  `Tm` is terms over six variable coordinates, zero, suc,
-- add.  `Step a b` is one rewrite, INCLUDING `reverse`, which is what makes
-- the derivation space a groupoid rather than a rewriting order.
-- `Derivation a b` is a walk: `done` and `then-step`, no relations imposed,
-- so two walks between the same endpoints are two distinct data.
--
-- THE SEMANTICS.  `eval : Tm → Env → ℕ`, and `derivation-sound` proves every
-- derivation preserves it at every environment.  `induction-sound` is the
-- real inference rule: a base trace plus a step trace with the hypothesis
-- available ONLY at the predecessor entails the equation for every
-- environment.  That is how a certificate becomes a universally quantified
-- theorem.
--
-- THE METACIRCULAR STEP, and it is one line:
--
--     install : Derivation lhs rhs → NativeOperation
--
-- A theorem the machine proved becomes a move the machine can make.  So the
-- library of operations is a learned policy; `EnabledFuture seed` -- the
-- operations whose control fires at this context -- is its forward pass; and
-- `advance` returns that as a LIST, with
--
--     advance-preserves-branch-count : length (advance fs) ≡ length fs
--
-- no dedupe, no sort, no quotient.  `GenerativeKernel.run-targets` exhibits
-- the point in three lines: two different derivations, one output.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §4.  THE FOUR READINGS OF THE KERNEL'S SOUNDNESS FIELDS.  (atemporal)
--
-- One fact generates all four: EVERY SOUNDNESS FIELD OF THIS KERNEL IS A MAP
-- INTO A PROPOSITION.  `control-sound` lands in `t ≡ source` and `Tm` is a
-- set; `derivation-sound` lands in `eval a ρ ≡ eval b ρ` and ℕ is a set.  A
-- map into a proposition carries zero bits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   Vyapti_…    THE KERNEL MEMORISES, and the type forces it.
--               `control-sound : Control t → t ≡ source` means the enabling
--               evidence at t IS an identification of t with the one term the
--               operation was installed at.  So every installed operation
--               fires at exactly one context and emits a constant, and a
--               library's reach is the finitely many heights of its sources
--               while `Tm` is infinite.  Exhibited on the kernel's own
--               library: `suc (suc (suc zero))` has no enabled future.
--               REPAIR, checked: control carrying a substitution witness,
--               Σ[u] (t ≡ subVar u lhs).  Soundness needs no new proof --
--               `eval-subVar` was already in RewriteCertificate, unused.
--               Generalisation is free in this calculus; memorisation is
--               what costs.
--
--   Sesa_…      THE DERIVATION CARRIES NO MEANING, so all of it is remainder.
--               Soundness factors through ∥ Derivation a b ∥₁ -- the
--               semantics used only THAT one exists, never WHICH.  The
--               truncation is strict: the kernel's own direct and detour
--               histories are 2 steps and 4 steps, distinct, with EQUAL
--               soundness proofs.  Hence cost does not factor, and then the
--               general no-go: for ANY C at any level and ANY φ of the
--               meaning, φ agrees on the cheap and the expensive derivation.
--               No semantic criterion selects the short proof.  Selection is
--               extra-semantic or it does not exist.
--
--   Ankapasa_…  SO THE SEMANTICS IS A DECATEGORIFICATION: eval keeps a
--               cardinality and drops the bijection.  The categorified
--               semantics is built there -- zero ↦ ⊥, suc ↦ Unit ⊎ −,
--               add ↦ ⊎, every Step an equivalence, `reverse` ↦ `invEquiv`.
--               The calculus always admitted it; nobody had written it.  Add
--               commutativity (sound, by +-comm) and at `add var var` it is a
--               LOOP: ℕ is forced to call it refl, the universe calls it the
--               swap, and `ua` of it is not refl -- proved by transporting
--               along it and getting `inr tt` back.  The bit a counting
--               readout provably cannot hold is a transposition.
--
--   Asesa_…     THE SYNTHESIS, one lemma.  If M is a proposition then
--               fiber f m ≃ A for every m: the fibre is not part of the
--               domain, it IS the domain.  So `Derivation a b` is one fibre
--               of its own soundness, both bindings of §2's law coincide,
--               and the kernel sits at the MAXIMALLY LOSSY end -- nothing is
--               charged on the output side because the output side holds
--               nothing.  And isEquiv (the measure that reads as perfect
--               self-knowledge) is refuted at the kernel's own seed.
--
-- IN ONE SENTENCE.  The kernel's readout is its SUPPORT, not its mass: it
-- can say THAT a continuation is correct and nothing about WHICH, HOW MANY,
-- or HOW LONG, and every quantity a policy would need lives in a fibre its
-- type collapses.  Which is why `advance-preserves-branch-count` is not
-- housekeeping -- it is the only place in the kernel where the collapsed
-- information is still held.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------

--      the surface.  In this order, reading terms and not headers.

-- they were added to those roots in this same commit.
--
-- WHAT THE KERNEL CAN DO TODAY, each backed by a term in the three files:
--   * represent terms, single rewrites, and their compositions PROOF-
--     RELEVANTLY, reversals included;
--   * certify that a derivation preserves ℕ-meaning at every environment
--     (`derivation-sound`);
--   * turn an induction certificate -- base trace, plus step trace with the
--     hypothesis only at the predecessor -- into a universally quantified
--     equation (`induction-sound`).  This is the kernel's actual inference
--     rule and it is the strongest thing in the three files;
--   * install any checked derivation as an executable operation (`install`);
--   * enumerate every enabled operation at a context with multiplicity
--     exactly conserved (`advance`, `advance-preserves-branch-count`);
--   * as of the Vyapti_ module, fire ONE operation over an infinite family
--     of contexts, soundly, at no proof cost.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §7.  WHAT IS NOT BUILT.  DATED 2026-08-24.  An absence without a command
--      is a rumour, so each carries the command that establishes it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   * NO GENERALISATION in `NativeOperation` -- and this one is not an
--     absence but a THEOREM: Vyapti_.enabled-set-is-subsingleton.
--
--   * NO DECISION PROCEDURE for `Control`, and NO SCORING, RANKING, SORTING
--     or SAMPLING of the enabled list.
--       grep -n 'Dec\|Bool\|sort\|rank' RewriteCertificate.agda \
--            ControlledGrammar.agda GenerativeKernel.agda      -> nothing
--     The kernel produces a branch set and has no policy over it.  By
--     Sesa_ that policy cannot be semantic, so this is a real gap and not an
--     oversight to patch with a heuristic.
--
--   * NO MULTIPLICATION in the kernel's `Tm`.
--       grep -n 'mul' NaturalMachine/RewriteCertificate.agda -> nothing
--
--   * THE GENERATIVE LOOP DOES NOT DRIVE THE KERNEL, and this is the largest
--     structural gap in the corpus.  `GenerativeLoop` proves a real thing --
--     an obstruction-indexed proposer that reads the residual of a FAILED
--     match, names the missing head, strictly decreases a deficit, and
--     terminates unconditionally.  It runs on `NaturalMachine.Obstruction`'s
--     `Tm`, which is a DIFFERENT datatype from the kernel's.
--       grep -rln '^data Tm *:' formal/cubical  -> 3 files:
--            Obstruction.agda, RewriteCertificate.agda, RewriteCertificateMul.agda
--       files importing BOTH Obstruction and RewriteCertificate -> ZERO
--     So the corpus contains a proved-terminating learner and a metacircular
--     kernel, and no morphism between their term languages.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- §8.  THE FRONTIER, DERIVED FROM §7 RATHER THAN LISTED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   (a) A `Tm`-morphism from Obstruction's language to the kernel's, under
--       which `propose` becomes `install`.  That is what closes the loop:
--       failed match → named missing structure → new operation → larger
--       enabled set, with the deficit measure already proved to descend.
--   (b) The schema of Vyapti_ raised from `subVar`'s one variable to all six
--       coordinates, and `install` replaced by `install-schema` in
--       ControlledGrammar so that generalisation is the kernel's default
--       rather than a companion module's.
--   (c) A policy over the enabled list that is honestly extra-semantic --
--       Sesa_ proves no semantic one exists, and lāghava is the obvious
--       candidate order.  It must not collapse to a boolean verdict
--       (Saptabhangi) and it must not dedupe (§3).
--   (d) The categorified semantics of Ankapasa_ carried from an example to a
--       theorem: relate ⟦t⟧ to `eval t` by cardinality, which needs
--       finiteness and is not proved anywhere here.
