-- यन्त्र — what the computer is: the groupoid of proofs-of-transport, not
-- the monoid of irreversible steps.
--
-- The owner asked, flatly: WHAT'S THE COMPUTER.  Not a metaphor — the
-- machine.  This file answers it as a checked term, and the answer is one
-- word with a proof: a GROUPOID.
--
-- A CLASSICAL COMPUTER's operations form a MONOID.  You can sequence
-- steps (∘) and there is a no-op (id), but you cannot in general UNDO a
-- step: erasing a bit is irreversible, and by Landauer it costs kT ln 2
-- of heat each time (Bennett: reversible computation has no such floor,
-- but pays per EXECUTION).  A monoid has composition and identity and NO
-- inverse.  That missing inverse is the heat.
--
-- THIS COMPUTER's operations are PROOFS OF TRANSPORT — equivalences
-- e : A ≃ B, equivalently paths ua e : A ≡ B (`PramanaSankramana`).  And
-- those form a GROUPOID: composition, identity, AND a two-sided inverse,
-- with the laws holding definitionally (the library proves each by
-- `equivEq refl`).  Every program is invertible; every run can be run
-- backwards to exactly where it began; nothing is erased.
--
-- [CORRECTED 2026-08-23.  This sentence ended "nothing is erased, so
-- nothing dissipates", and §4's comment read "the added field is the
-- reversibility, hence (Landauer) the zero-heat floor".  **Neither
-- consequent is supported by any term in this file**, and the original
-- WHAT-IS-NOT-CLAIMED fence covered the unitarity/gauge reading while
-- leaving the thermodynamic one standing.  "Nothing is erased" is
-- checked below (§2's inverse laws) and is a statement about types;
-- "nothing dissipates" is a statement about a physical implementation,
-- of which there is none here — no energy, no temperature, no entropy,
-- no measure appears in this file.  Landauer's principle is the MOTIVE
-- for asking which step is non-injective, and the precise typal content
-- of "erases nothing" is `Vyapti_TheLossOrderIsCoarsening…agda` §६: the
-- collision type `विस्मृतिः Φ` is empty when `Φ` is an equivalence.
-- That is the whole of it.  No heat is derived and no physical constant
-- is on this page.]
--
-- The groupoid IS the computer, and the presence of the
-- inverse — the one thing the monoid lacks — is the whole difference.
--
-- यन्त्र (yantra) is the corpus's word for the machine (`Yantra_The-
-- OrgansAreOneMachineOnOneWire`).  No sūtra claimed.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED (all reusing the library's checked equivalence laws, so
-- these are the machine's instruction-set laws, not new mathematics):
--
--   §2  the five groupoid laws on Receipt = _≃_:
--       एकाग्रता-वाम / -दक्षिण   identity is a two-sided no-op
--       प्रतिलोमः-दक्षिण / -वाम   inverse is two-sided (the run undoes)
--       साहचर्यम्                composition is associative (sequencing)
--   §3  चालनम् : running a program IS transport along its path.
--       चालनं-प्रतिलोम्यम् : every run has an inverse run — reversible.
--       चालन-सन्धिः : composing programs, then running, = running each in
--       turn (the machine is a functor from the groupoid to functions).
--   §4  the contrast, as types: a MONOID interface has ∘ and id and no
--       inverse field; the groupoid adds प्रतिलोमः.  The added field is
--       the reversibility.  (NOT the heat — see the correction inset.)
--
-- WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT COMPUTER FOR COMPUTATIONAL SPACETIME.  Physics is
-- reversible (unitary evolution, time-symmetric microdynamics); its state
-- moves by PARALLEL TRANSPORT along paths, and indistinguishable
-- configurations are genuinely identified (gauge / general covariance).
-- A groupoid of transports is exactly that structure: paths compose and
-- invert, and univalence (`ua`) makes equivalent types EQUAL — so the
-- machine cannot even express a difference between physically
-- indistinguishable states.  General covariance is not imposed on this
-- computer; it is what its equality IS.  (Stated as motivation, not
-- proved here — the proved content is §§2–4, the groupoid.)
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED:
--   * The physics correspondence (unitarity, gauge) as a theorem — it is
--     the reading; the checked content is the groupoid structure.
--   * That the repository's RUNNING apparatus (the kernel exit-0/42 gate,
--     the git stream, the disposable minds, the Rust evolve loop) is
--     literally this groupoid — that apparatus is the SUBSTRATE that
--     CHECKS these terms; this file names the machine those terms form.
--   * Univalence itself (imported, checked in the library).
--   * ANY THERMODYNAMICS.  No heat, energy, temperature, entropy, measure
--     or Landauer bound is derived, bounded, or implied by any term below;
--     kT ln 2 appears once, in the opening paragraph, as the historical
--     motive and not as a consequence.  See the correction inset above.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 (the container, NOT the
-- repository pin), --cubical --safe, exit 0, re-checked 2026-08-23.
