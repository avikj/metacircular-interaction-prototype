-- Krama — what a recitation order cannot seat at any price.
--
-- Dviḥpāṭha showed a family whose cost falls from three anubandhas to two
-- when a sound may be recited twice.  That reads as an economy: repetition
-- saves a marker.  It is not an economy.  It lifts an OBSTRUCTION, and the
-- gap is not one marker but every marker there is.
--
-- SOURCE.  Pāṇini, *Aṣṭādhyāyī* 1.1.71 ādir antyena sahetā, over the
-- fourteen Māheśvara-sūtras: the sounds in one recited line, classes named
-- as the stretch from a sound to an antya.  *Krama* is the tradition's word
-- for sequence — the krama-pāṭha is the first of the vikṛti recitations
-- (Prātiśākhya literature, ~500 BCE), where the order itself is the object
-- under discipline.  Here the object is likewise the order, and the
-- question is what orders can hold.
--
-- THE FAMILY.  Three sounds a b c; the three two-element classes
--
--     C = { {a b}, {b c}, {a c} }
--
-- pairwise ⊆-incomparable (§2), so width 3 and
-- `PratyaharaLaghava.markersDistinct` forces three anubandhas.
--
--   §3  `कदापि-न-आसीदति` — NO recitation order seats C, at ANY number of
--       anubandhas, when each sound is recited once.  Exhaustive over the
--       six orders in their marker-saturated form.
--   §4  `आवृत्त्या-आसीदति` — with repetition, three anubandhas seat C:
--       a b M₁ c a M₂ b c M₃.  Exactly the width.  The bound is attained.
--
-- So on this family μ₀ = ∞ and μ_∞ = 3 = width.  Repetition is not a
-- discount on the marker count.  It is the difference between nameable and
-- not nameable at all.
--
-- WHY SIX LINES ARE THE WHOLE SPACE (the WLOG, and it is airtight rather
-- than convenient).  Let L be any recited-once line naming C.  All three
-- sounds occur in L, each once, so L's sounds are one of six orders, and
-- every anubandha of L sits in one of the four gaps that order leaves.
-- Now: ADDING an anubandha never removes a class.  Inserting a marker into
-- L leaves the sound content of every stretch untouched — `prefixBefore m'`
-- for an existing m' gains at most an interleaved marker, `suffixFromLast s`
-- likewise, and a class is recorded by which SOUNDS it meets, markers being
-- boundaries and never members.  So every class of L is a class of the
-- saturated line for L's order, which carries a marker in all four gaps.
-- Six saturated lines therefore name a superset of everything any
-- recited-once line names, at any marker count whatsoever, and §3 checks
-- all six.  A marker in the first gap precedes no sound and names nothing;
-- it is kept so the saturation is visibly complete rather than pruned.
--
-- WHY, underneath the exhaustion.  `Antya.…` proves that a class is always
-- the suffix, from the nearest preceding recitation, of the stretch before
-- its antya — hence a contiguous factor of the line.  Recited once, the
-- sounds of a contiguous factor are an INTERVAL of the order, and {a c} is
-- an interval of no order in which b lies between them, which every order
-- seating {a b} and {b c} must be.  Repetition breaks this because a sound
-- gets a second position: `Antya.स्वच्छादिः-अन्त्येन` asks freshness only
-- to the RIGHT of the start, and never asks anything of what stands left.
-- That is the whole mechanism, and it is why the obstruction is not a cost.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED:
--
--   * That the śiva-sūtra family contains such a cycle.  IT DOES, and the
--     first draft of this header said the opposite.  Three ATTESTED
--     pratyāhāras, restricted to the three sounds h y ś, are exactly C:
--
--        aṬ  = a i u ṛ ḷ e o ai au h y v r      ↾ {h y ś} = {h y}
--        śaL = ś ṣ s h                          ↾ {h y ś} = {ś h}
--        yaR = y v r l … k p ś ṣ s              ↾ {h y ś} = {y ś}
--
--     (sets recomputed from the fourteen sūtras, `machine/Astadhyayi.hs`
--     sivasutraTable; names from the attested list in
--     `machine/Pratyahara_TheIntervalDecisionProcedure.hs`.)  h stands in
--     sūtra 5 (ha ya va ra Ṭ) and again in sūtra 14 (ha L) — before y, and
--     after ś — which is precisely the seat no single order provides.  So
--     the second h is not economy.  It is what makes the list nameable at
--     all.  That claim is NOT checked in this file: it needs the
--     restriction step, class ⟹ contiguous factor ⟹ interval after
--     restriction, and that is owed as the successor to this one.
--   * The interval / consecutive-ones characterisation in general (Booth–
--     Lueker PQ-trees; Kornai, Kiparsky).  `PratyaharaLaghava` lists that
--     as owed and it stays owed; §3 is one witness, not a theory.
--   * μ_k for 0 < k < ∞, still open, still where Pāṇini's line sits.
--   * Petersen 2004.  Owed, unread, egress blocked.
--   * Any phonological content for a b c.  Three abstract sounds.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  Every claim is `refl`.
