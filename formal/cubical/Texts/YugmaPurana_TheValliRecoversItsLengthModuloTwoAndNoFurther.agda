-- युग्म-पूरणम् — वल्ली स्वदैर्घ्यं द्वाभ्यां भागं स्मरति, न ततः परम् ।
--
-- (the even padding: the vallī recovers its length modulo two, and no
--  further.)
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS IS.  This corpus holds THREE no-decoder theorems, in two
-- lanes and two languages, proved by three unrelated arguments — and all
-- three are sharp at exactly ℤ/2.  None of them says so, and none cites
-- another.  A uniform random draw found the coincidence; this module is
-- the one line that explains it.
--
--   `KuttakaValli.detReplay`     (Agda)  det (replay v) ≡ sgn v, where
--       sgn = (−1)^length.  A PARTIAL DECODER: the endpoint matrix does
--       recover the vallī's length mod 2, because every step matrix
--       L q = (q 1 / 1 0) has determinant −1.
--
--   `Pairfield/DiagonalSmithRoute.lean.no_historical_actionCost_decoder`
--       refutes a length decoder with [0,1,1,2] against [0,0,0,1,1,2] —
--       a padding of **+2**.  `IntMat2.euclidStep q = ⟨0,1,1,−q⟩` is the
--       same matrix family, determinant −1, always.
--
--   `Pairfield/EuclidCoefficientTrace.lean.no_value_cost_decoder`
--       uses [inc] against [inc,inc,dec] — **+2** again, by a completely
--       different argument, where value = #inc − #dec and cost = #inc +
--       #dec, so cost ≡ value (mod 2) identically.
--
-- THE PADDING HAD TO BE EVEN, and §2 is the proof.  An odd padding is
-- IMPOSSIBLE as a counterexample: the determinant would separate the two
-- words.  So those theorems are not merely true, they are TIGHT, and the
-- quotient at which they are tight is the parity quotient.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- READ AGAINST THE CRITERION.  For `replay : Valli → M`, the question is
-- which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound.  Bind the vallī and the matrix rides
-- free (that is `replay` being a function).  Bind the MATRIX and you have
-- the preimage — and this module computes exactly how much of it the
-- matrix sees: the parity, and nothing else.
--
-- So the three verdicts of `Tantujala_TheFibreHasThreeVerdictsAndIsContr-
-- MergesTwoOfThem.agda` are not the whole story at a lossy map.  A fibre
-- with MANY points still admits an exact statement of WHAT IS RECOVERED,
-- and here it is a quotient group.  नष्टि is not "everything is lost":
-- §४ of अहिंसा-सूत्र-विस्तारः says यत् तिष्ठति, कः नश्यति — the THAT
-- survives and the WHICH is destroyed.  This module names the surviving
-- THAT precisely: it is ℤ/2, and no more.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF THE SOURCE.  The वल्ली is ĀRYABHAṬA's,
-- आर्यभटीयम् गणितपादः ३२–३३, 499 CE — "शेषं रक्ष", keep the remainder.
-- Āryabhaṭa proved nothing below and none of this is attributed to him.
-- What is claimed is only that the object these theorems are about is the
-- column of quotients his procedure produces, and that its length is
-- exactly what a replay forgets down to parity.  युग्म ("pair, even") and
-- पूरण ("filling, padding") are used in their plain senses; no text is
-- claimed for the compound.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0 + agda/cubical v0.9, --cubical --safe, no
-- postulates, no holes.

-- २ · युग्म-पूरणम् अदृश्यम् — AN EVEN PADDING IS INVISIBLE.
--
-- Two steps prepended leave the determinant exactly where it was, because
-- (−1)·(−1) = 1.  This is the whole reason the two Lean counterexamples
-- both pad by +2 and could not have padded by +1: the padding must be
-- invisible to the determinant, and only even paddings are.

-- ३ · विषम-पूरणम् दृश्यम् — AN ODD PADDING IS VISIBLE.
--
-- One step prepended NEGATES the determinant.  So parity is not merely
-- preserved by the even paddings — it is genuinely READ by the
-- determinant, and a would-be counterexample of odd length difference is
-- separated on the spot.

-- ४ · यत् तिष्ठति — WHAT SURVIVES, EXACTLY.
--
-- Put §1 and §2 together.  The determinant of a replay is a function of
-- the vallī's length alone (§1), and it is blind to every even change in
-- that length (§2) while separating every odd one (§3).  So what a replay
-- retains of its trace is precisely the length modulo two.
--
-- This is the sharpening the three no-decoder theorems were missing.  They
-- prove a decoder does not exist; this says the obstruction is exactly the
-- parity quotient and not one bit more, and it says WHY their witnesses
-- have the shape they have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

यत्-तिष्ठति : (v w : Valli) → length v ≡ length w
            → det (replay v) ≡ det (replay w)
यत्-तिष्ठति v w p = detReplay v ∙ चिह्नं-दैर्घ्यात् v w p ∙ sym (detReplay w)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ५ · शेषः — what this does NOT say.
--
-- It does not say the fibre of `replay` is the set of vallīs of a given
-- parity: `replay` forgets far more than length, and two vallīs of one
-- parity generally have different matrices.  The claim is only about what
-- the DETERMINANT sees, which is the coordinate all three no-decoder
-- theorems' witnesses were built to defeat.
--
-- It does not compute the fibre of `replay` itself.  That fibre is the
-- subject rather than a defect — `Gamma0Freeness` is where it lives — and
-- computing it would be a different module.
--
-- And it does not transfer to the Lean lane as a term.  The two
-- `IntMat2`/`euclidStep` results are stated there over a different matrix
-- type in a system without univalence, so the identification is grade
-- three: a real channel, to be constructed rather than asserted.  Stated
-- here as owed, not as done.
--
-- [2026-08-22 — PAID, and paid the only way a grade-three channel can be.]
-- `formal/pairfield/Pairfield/YugmaPurana_TheEvenPaddingIsForcedAndThe-
-- DeterminantSaysWhy.lean` proves §२–§४ again over `IntMat2`, natively, and
-- states the tightness at the two Lean sites:
--   · `DiagonalEuclidTranscript.det_leftWord`  — det of an n-letter Euclidean
--     word is (−1)^n, the counterpart of `KuttakaValli.detReplay`;
--   · `leftWord_cons_ne`                       — §३ here, an odd padding is
--     visible;
--   · `endpoints_force_even_actionCost_gap`    — every witness refuting
--     `no_historical_actionCost_decoder` has an even gap;
--   · `CoefficientWitness.value_forces_cost_parity` — the same for
--     `no_value_cost_decoder`, whose proof mentions no matrix at all.
-- NOTHING WAS TRANSPORTED.  No term crosses the lane boundary, the two
-- matrix families are not even equal (`L q = (q 1 / 1 0)` against
-- `euclidStep q = (0 1 / 1 −q)`); both lie in {M : det M = −1} and the
-- argument needs nothing else of either.  The channel is two independent
-- proofs that agree, which is what construction means here.
