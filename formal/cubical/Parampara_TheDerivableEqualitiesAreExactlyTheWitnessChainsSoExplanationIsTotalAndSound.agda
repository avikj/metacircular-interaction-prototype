-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- परम्परा — the unbroken lineage of transmission.  The e-graph's proof
-- forest (runtime/kernel/egraph.py, L2: "every union stores the
-- justification, so any derived equality can emit a checkable path") rests
-- on one theorem, declared there and proved here:
--
--     the EQUIVALENCE CLOSURE of the axiom set coincides exactly with
--     the ZIGZAG CHAINS of justified steps.
--
--   • COMPLETE (§2): every derivable equality — built from axioms by
--     refl, sym, trans, the operations the union-find performs — flattens
--     to a chain of steps, each one axiom used forward or backward.  This
--     is explain()'s totality: whatever the e-graph merged, a path can be
--     emitted.  sym is chain reversal, trans is concatenation: the proof
--     forest needs to store only the steps, because the derivation
--     structure above them is recoverable bureaucracy.
--
--   • SOUND (§1): every chain folds back into a derivation — an emitted
--     path certifies nothing but a derivable equality.
--
-- So "derived in the court" and "transmitted through an unbroken lineage
-- of witnessed steps" are one relation — paramparā: each link cites its
-- witness, forward or backward, and nothing else is needed.  Nothing here
-- is about hash-consing or find(): this is the invariant that LICENSES
-- storing a forest of justifications instead of whole derivations.
--
-- CHECKED under the pin (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9).
