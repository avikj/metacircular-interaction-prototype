-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- वन-सेतु — the bridge into the forest.  The Liouville/parity program's
-- central object (notes/FOREST.md, notes/DIRECT.md) has been prose and
-- Lean-lane since the pair-field days; this is its exact arithmetic
-- interface as a checked cubical term, orthogonal to the fibre/transport
-- spine.  Two facts, both exact, no numerics:
--
--   §1  THE SHIFT–DILATION INTERFACE.  On sequences X = ℕ → A with the
--       shift (σ x)(n) = x(n+1) and the dilations (D_m x)(n) = x(m·n),
--       FOREST.md §1 states the exact commutation that governs the whole
--       program — the multiplicative dilations do NOT preserve the
--       additive shift, and the exact defect is:
--
--           σ ∘ D_m  ≡  D_m ∘ σ^m                    (checked here)
--
--       i.e. shifting a dilated sequence by one is dilating a sequence
--       shifted by m.  This is the σ D_m = D_m σ^m of FOREST.md/DIRECT.md,
--       and it is the reason M (the multiplicative eigenvectors) is not
--       shift-invariant — the interface the whole Liouville question
--       turns on.
--
--   §2  THE LIOUVILLE POINT IS AN EIGENVECTOR OF EVERY DILATION.  For a
--       completely multiplicative sign sequence (x(m·n) = x(m)·x(n),
--       here over the sign group (Bool, xor) with -1 = true), FOREST.md's
--       characterisation D_p λ = -λ becomes, exactly: if x(m) = -1 then
--       D_m x = -x pointwise.  The Liouville function is the point with
--       x(p) = -1 at every prime; §2 proves the eigen-relation from
--       complete multiplicativity alone, at ANY m with x(m) = -1, no
--       primality needed for the algebra.
--
-- TERM.  The forest and its objects are the corpus's (FOREST.md,
-- cf-prouhet/weaver lane); no external source is claimed.  Signs live in
-- (Bool, _xor_): false = +1, true = -1, so multiplication of signs is
-- xor and "negate" is `not`.  Exact, finite, --safe.
