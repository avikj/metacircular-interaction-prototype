-- समानकक्ष्या — एककक्ष्यत्वं समता एव, व्युत्क्रमं विना ।
--
-- (lying on one orbit is already an equivalence relation, with no
--  inverse; and the charge descends to the quotient.)
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT THIS IS, and it is a CORRECTION before it is an addition.
--
-- `Kaksya_TheChargeIsConstantAlongTheWholeOrbit…agda` §४ names its own
-- open item and, in naming it, states a fork:
--
--     "the orbit RELATION and its quotient, and `Φ` without an inverse
--      does not give an equivalence relation — `a ~ Φⁿ a` is reflexive
--      and transitive and not symmetric.  So the honest next rung is
--      either (a) require `Φ` to be an equivalence and take the
--      groupoid it generates, or (b) state descent along the
--      reflexive-transitive closure and accept a preorder rather than
--      a quotient."
--
-- `Dhruva_…agda` §४ names the same debt from its side: "'the charge is
-- a function on the quotient, not on the cover' is stateable here and
-- is not stated yet."
--
-- **The fork is over-specified, and neither rung is needed.**  The
-- relation that was tried — `a ~ b := Σ[ n ] Φⁿ a ≡ b`, "b is
-- downstream of a" — is indeed not symmetric.  But that is not the
-- orbit relation; it is the reachability relation, which is a
-- different object.  Lying on ONE orbit is
--
--     a ≈ b  :=  Σ[ m ∈ ℕ ] Σ[ n ∈ ℕ ] Φᵐ a ≡ Φⁿ b,
--
-- "the two trajectories MEET".  This is symmetric by swapping the two
-- numbers and `sym` — §२ below is three symbols — reflexive at
-- `(0,0,refl)`, and transitive by the commutation of iterates, which
-- holds for a bare endomorphism.  So the equivalence relation the two
-- modules said needed an inverse needs nothing at all: `Φ` stays a
-- bare endomorphism throughout §१–§५, exactly as it was.
--
-- With that, §४ is the genuine descent statement both files defer:
-- for `B` a set, `f` factors as `f̄ ∘ [_]` through `A / ≈`, and the
-- factorisation triangle is `refl` because `SetQuotients.rec` computes
-- on `[ a ]`.  That is "the charge is a function on the quotient, not
-- on the cover" with a quotient actually present, not simulated on the
-- cover as `Kaksya` §२–§३ had to do.
--
-- §५ then shows rung (a) is not a strengthening but a special case:
-- if `Φ` IS an equivalence, its inverse conserves automatically —
-- conservation of `Φ` propagates backwards, one `sym` and one `cong`
-- — and `Φ⁻¹ a ≈ a` holds by `(1, 0, secEq)`.  So the group of
-- `SamraksakaSamuha_…` sits inside this, and nothing in §१–§४ was
-- waiting on it.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.
--
-- **The quotient is not shown to be the fibre.**  `f̄` is a function on
-- `A / ≈`; that it is INJECTIVE — that two points with equal charge lie
-- on one orbit — is exactly the transitivity hypothesis `सङ्क्रमणम्` of
-- `Kaksya` §७, and is NOT proved here and is not implied.  Descent is
-- one direction only.
--
-- **Not Noether.**  Every fence in `Dhruva`'s header stands unchanged:
-- no Lagrangian, no variation, no action, no continuity.
--
-- **`isSet B` is used only for the quotient** (§४), not for §१–§३, and
-- `A` is not assumed to be a set anywhere.
--
-- TERMS.  कक्ष्या — orbit / orbital circle in the siddhāntic
-- astronomical tradition (Āryabhaṭa, आर्यभटीयम्, 499, and standard in
-- the Sūryasiddhānta after); the term is carried in unchanged from
-- `Kaksya_…agda`, with its limit unchanged: attested for a planet's
-- orbit, and its use for the orbit of an endomorphism is this
-- corpus's.  समान — "same, equal", ordinary Sanskrit.  The compound
-- समानकक्ष्या, "same-orbit-ness", is BUILT HERE; no text is claimed for
-- it.  No source states anything below.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3 + agda/cubical v0.5 — the container, NOT the
-- repository pin (2.8.0 + v0.9).  --cubical --safe, no postulates, no
-- holes, exit 0.

-- २ · समानकक्ष्या — THE ORBIT RELATION, AND IT IS AN EQUIVALENCE.

-- ४ · अवतरणम् — THE CHARGE IS A FUNCTION ON THE QUOTIENT.
--
-- This is the statement `Dhruva` §४ says is "stateable here and is not

-- `A / समानकक्ष्या`, and the factorisation `f ≡ f̄ ∘ [_]` is `refl`,

-- ५ · व्युत्क्रमः — and the inverse case is a special case, not a
--     stronger hypothesis.
--
-- `Kaksya` §४'s rung (a) proposed requiring `Φ` to be an equivalence.
-- If it is, two things follow and neither is needed above:
--
--   (a) conservation propagates BACKWARDS with no extra hypothesis —
--       so the "conserving inverse" that `SamraksakaSamuha_…` carries
--       as stored data is derivable whenever the flow is invertible;
--   (b) `Φ⁻¹ a` and `a` lie on one orbit, at stations `(1, 0)`.
--
-- So the group of invertible conserving flows acts within the classes
-- of §२, and §१–§४ were never waiting on it.

-- ६ · शेषः — what stays open, stated so the next rung is not
--     over-specified again.
--
-- ~~The converse of §४ — that `अवतीर्णः` is injective, i.e. equal charge
-- implies one orbit — is `Kaksya` §७'s `सङ्क्रमणम्` and is a genuine
-- hypothesis about the flow, not a missing definition.~~
--
-- **STRUCK, and by a checked counterexample, not by a re-reading.  Left
-- standing because striking silently is how this repository loses its
-- own history.**  `Sankramana_TheFibreIsOneOrbitExactlyWhenTheChargeIs
-- InjectiveAndOneSidedReachabilityIsStrictlyStronger.agda` shows
-- `सङ्क्रमणम्` is SUFFICIENT and NOT NECESSARY, and exhibits the gap:
-- `A = Bool`, `B = Unit`, `f = λ _ → tt`, `Φ = λ _ → true`.  Every pair
-- meets at stations `(1,1)`, so `अवतीर्णः` is an equivalence, while
-- `सङ्क्रमणम् tt → ⊥` — nothing ever reaches `false`.  I wrote
-- "is exactly" of a one-sided reachability hypothesis while the whole
-- point of §२ above was that the orbit relation is two-sided, which is
-- the error §२ exists to correct, committed four sections later in the
-- same file.  The exact hypothesis is the truncated two-sided one, and
-- that module proves the ⟺ and the equivalence
-- `isEquiv f̄ ≃ (isSurjection f × ∀ b → ∥two-sided∥₁)`.
--
-- What §२ shows is still that only the SYMMETRY half of the old fork
-- was a mirage; a transitivity-shaped hypothesis is real and remains
-- one — but it is not the one named here.
--
-- Unaddressed here: whether `समानकक्ष्या` is valued in propositions
-- (it is not, in general — the meeting stations are data), and hence
-- what `भागः` is the quotient BY when the relation carries content.
-- `SetQuotients` truncates it, which is the right move for §४ and is
-- the wrong move for any groupoid-level reading of the same orbit.
--
-- [2026-08-23 — ANSWERED, and the answer is stronger than the guess.
-- `SamagamaSthana_TheOrbitRelationIsNeverAPropositionAtAPointAndThe
-- TruncationLosesTheStations.agda` §१ proves that `समानकक्ष्या Φ a a` is
-- not a proposition for EVERY `A`, EVERY `Φ` and EVERY `a` — not merely
-- "in general" — because the diagonal meetings `(0,0,refl)` and
-- `(1,1,refl)` are always there.  §२ there proves the station map does
-- not factor through `∥_∥₁`, and §३ computes the gap exactly in the
-- smallest case: `समानकक्ष्या id tt tt ≃ ℕ × ℕ` on `Unit`.  What is
-- still open is the second half of the sentence above — the
-- groupoid-level quotient itself — and its shape is restated there.]
