--
-- ====================================================================
-- THE TWO SOURCES, WHAT IS CLAIMED OF THEM, AND WHAT IS NOT.
--
--   DIGNĀGA, *Pramāṇasamuccaya* V (c. 480-540).  अन्यापोह / anyāpoha:
--   a general term carries no positive shared feature.  Its content is
--   the exclusion of what it is not.  A term is fixed by its contrast.
--
--   DHARMAKĪRTI, *Pramāṇavārttika* (c. 600-660).  अर्थक्रिया /
--   arthakriyā: effect-performing capacity.  Dharmakīrti keeps apoha
--   and puts a causal ground under it -- particulars fall together
--   because they do the same work, and the exclusion is downstream of
--   that, not primitive.
--
-- THEY DISAGREE, AND THE DISAGREEMENT IS THE OBJECT HERE, NOT A SEAM TO
-- BE SMOOTHED.  Dignāga's exclusion has no positive ground behind it;
-- Dharmakīrti supplies one.  What forced the move is on the record from
-- the other side: Uddyotakara (*Nyāyavārttika*) and Kumārila
-- (*Ślokavārttika*, Apohavāda) press that an exclusion is never bare --
-- it carries the very thing whose absence it is -- so exclusion cannot
-- be the ground.  This corpus already carries that exchange, in
-- `NaturalMachine.ExclusionRecoversGroundAtAPrice` (which names the two
-- rivals and refuses to adjudicate them) and in
-- `ApohaParyaya_WhetherConceptualContentIsNegativeIsWhatTheTwoSchools-
-- ActuallyDispute` (which locates the Bauddha-Jaina dispute).  Neither
-- of those is the Bauddha-internal split, and neither is this file's
-- question.
--
-- CLAIMED OF THE SOURCES: only the distinction between individuating a
-- thing by what it excludes and individuating it by what it does, and
-- that the two men ground these differently.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED: that either wrote about separating families, machine
-- state, or memory; that anything below is a reconstruction of apoha;
-- that either would accept the modelling in §1.  Nothing below is a
-- verdict on Dignāga.  §6 says exactly how narrow the verdict is.
--
-- PROVENANCE GRADE, stated because an unchecked provenance is the same
-- class of error as a fitted constant: author, work, approximate date,
-- and the doctrine each work is known for.  NO chapter or verse is
-- verified against an edition; this container has no route to a text,
-- and no verse number is asserted anywhere above or below.
--
-- ====================================================================
-- THE OBJECT: HOW BIG IS A MEMORY, AND THE TWO ANSWERS.
--
-- `notes/CONTEXTUAL_QUANTUM_DIMENSION.md` (codex-quantum-process,
-- 2026-08-12), broadcast as
-- `collab/messages/0313-codex-quantum-process-contextual-quantum-
-- dimension-result.md`, prices one finite process two ways:
--
--   k = cdim  -- the minimum number of contexts whose joint response
--                separates every class.  How many exclusions pin a
--                state down.  ANYĀPOHA'S NUMBER.
--   Q         -- the cardinality of the predictive quotient: how many
--                distinct response laws must coexist.  How much work
--                the states do.  ARTHAKRIYĀ'S NUMBER.
--
-- and proves `Q ≤ m^k` (m the observation-alphabet size), with an
-- equality family attaining it.  The note's own instruction is to
-- report the pair and never to call cdim a memory dimension.
--
-- The lenses split on which number IS the memory, and this module is
-- that split, checked:
--
--   §3  ARTHAKRIYĀ.  Once a family separates, the relation it induces
--       is equality -- so the effect quotient does not depend on which
--       separating family was offered.  General, any carrier.
--
--   §4-§5  ANYĀPOHA.  On ONE carrier, Bool × Bool, with the SAME
--       quotient throughout, three separating families whose minimum
--       sizes are 1, 2 and 3.  The exclusion count is a function of the
--       contrast class offered, not of the thing individuated.
--
-- §6: on this object Dharmakīrti's criterion picks out the invariant
-- and Dignāga's does not, for the reason Dharmakīrti gave.
--
-- ====================================================================
-- §2 REFUTES A CLAIM OF MINE.  I read `Q ≤ m^k` together with its
-- equality family and formed
--
--     CLAIM R:  cdim = ⌈log_m Q⌉, i.e. Q and m determine k.
--
-- It is false, and `Ind-needs-three` below kills it: m = 2, Q = 4,
-- ⌈log₂ 4⌉ = 2, cdim = 3.  The equality family in the note is not
-- generic; equality there was obtained by CHOOSING the admitted
-- contexts.  `Q ≤ m^k` prices the best alphabet, never the one in hand.
-- My first witness attempt is also recorded dead, in §5.
--
-- CLAIM R WAS MINE AND 0313 NEVER MADE IT.  The note states `Q ≤ m^k`
-- and exhibits ONE family attaining equality; it does not say equality
-- is generic, and its "changed motion" says the opposite.  There is
-- also a modelling gap I do not close: the note's admitted contexts are
-- the unary polynomial contexts GENERATED by an algebra, and the
-- families below are stipulated.  I do not know whether `Ind` arises
-- that way, so nothing here contradicts 0313 and nothing here is
-- offered as a correction to it.  What is refuted is my own reading.

-- 1.  THE MODELLING, STATED BEFORE IT IS USED.
--
-- A FAMILY is a set of admitted contexts, each an observable on the
-- carrier with its own observation type.  This is the corpus's existing
-- object: a probe is a total response map (`machinery/
-- active_observer_design.py`), a channel's content is its fibre
-- partition (`runtime/render/channel.py`), and a standpoint is an
-- observable `q : X → Y` (`NaturalMachine.ExclusionRecoversGround-
-- AtAPrice`).  The one addition is that the INDEX is part of the data,
-- because the whole question below is whether the size of the index is
-- determined by anything other than itself.
--
-- The index is a TYPE, not an entry in an enumeration; nothing here
-- assumes the admitted contexts are countable.

-- 3.  ARTHAKRIYĀ.  THE EFFECT RELATION IS NOT A FUNCTION OF THE FAMILY.
--
-- If F separates, then everything F identifies, EVERY family identifies
-- -- because F identifies only identicals, and identicals are
-- identified by anything.  So among separating families the induced
-- relation is one and the same relation, on any carrier, with no
-- finiteness, decidability or size hypothesis anywhere.
--
-- This is the exact sense in which "how many response laws coexist" is
-- an invariant of the process: it is `_≡_` on the carrier, and the
-- admitted contexts drop out.

--
-- Carrier: four states.  By §3 the effect quotient is the same for all
-- three families below -- it is equality on `St`, four classes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

--     St itself, m = 4.

--     is the one that answers no to everything.

-- 5.  NO TWO OF THE THREE INDICATORS SEPARATE.
--
-- Each pair leaves one collision standing, and the survivor is always
-- the unnamed fourth state: an exclusion family that names three things

-- 5'.  MY FIRST WITNESS, RECORDED DEAD.
--
-- Before the indicators I tried {p₀ , p₁ , parity} as the three-context
-- family, on the reasoning that parity is "a context the coordinates do
-- not name".  It witnesses nothing: any two of its three members
-- already separate, because parity plus either coordinate recovers the
-- other.  Checked below rather than asserted, since the whole content
-- of §5 is a claim about subfamilies and I do not get to make that
-- claim loosely in one place and tightly in another.
--
-- What the dead attempt shows, and the reason it is kept: three
-- contexts do not make cdim three.  The indicators work because their
-- supports are singletons and their union misses a state -- withdrawing
-- a name makes a state unnamed, not merely less finely named.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

par : St → Bool
par x = fst x ⊕ snd x

reconPar : Bool → Bool → St
reconPar u v = (u , u ⊕ v)

reconPar-ok : (x : St) → reconPar (p₀ x) (par x) ≡ x
reconPar-ok (false , false) = refl
reconPar-ok (false , true)  = refl
reconPar-ok (true  , false) = refl
reconPar-ok (true  , true)  = refl

-- so a two-member subfamily of {p₀ , p₁ , par} already separates:
p₀-par-sep : Separating (Pair p₀ par)
p₀-par-sep x y u =
  sym (reconPar-ok x)
  ∙ (λ i → reconPar (u false i) (u true i))
  ∙ reconPar-ok y

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6.  THE SPLIT, AND HOW NARROW THE VERDICT IS.
--
-- Same carrier, same effect quotient throughout (§3 applied to the
-- three separating families of §4).  Minimum admitted-context counts:
-- one for `Whole`, two for `Coord` (§4, `p₀-alone-fails`,
-- `p₁-alone-fails`), three for `Ind` (§5).
--
-- So: the effect count is an invariant of the carrier; the exclusion
-- count is a function of the contrast class handed to you, and not of
-- the thing individuated.  On the question "how big is the memory",
-- arthakriyā answers and anyāpoha, alone, cannot -- and the mechanism
-- of the failure is the one Dharmakīrti's causal ground was introduced
-- to repair, and the one Uddyotakara and Kumārila pressed from outside.
--
-- HOW NARROW.  This is a verdict about ONE question about ONE object,
-- and it is not a ranking of two men or two positions.  Dignāga's
-- number is real and it is not memory: `notes/CONTEXTUAL_QUANTUM_-
-- DIMENSION.md` already priced it as interrogation cost, and the three
-- families above are three interrogation designs for one memory, which
-- is a fact about designs and not a defect in any of them.  A term
-- fixed by its contrast is a perfectly good term; it is just not a
-- cardinality.  Anything stronger than that would be a durnaya --
-- a standpoint asserting itself by denying another -- and this module
-- does not assert it.
--
-- NOT SETTLED HERE: the minimum over ALL families on a carrier (that is
-- a quantity, and §4 gives one at 1 for `St`); whether `Whole`'s
-- alphabet-size 4 should be charged against its context count, which is
-- the trade `Q ≤ m^k` prices and which no theorem above bounds from
-- below for a GIVEN family; and Dignāga's own scope analysis of "the
-- other" (synonyms, sub- and superordinates), which
-- `notes/EXCLUSION_IS_NOT_AN_OPERATOR.md` §3 also records as OPEN.
