-- EGBThreadYoneda
--
-- D0025 §4 and T25.A, made a theorem about this net rather than a
-- picture about categories in general.
--
-- §4 boxes two claims:
--
--     a thread between jewels
--       = a coherent transformation between their total reflection profiles
--
--     a jewel is completely determined, up to the correct equivalence,
--       by how every other jewel maps into it
--
-- and T25.A asks for `Map(x,y) ≃ Nat(y x, y y)` in the chosen setting.
-- This file proves both directions of that correspondence for the
-- prime-pair net of `EGBRootedNet`, with the naturality condition
-- written out rather than inherited.
--
-- THE PREREQUISITE, and why it was not free.  `EGBRootedNet.Thread` is
-- the sum of two exact relations (shared centre, shared radius).
-- Neither is closed under composition with the other: a shared-centre
-- thread followed by a shared-radius thread is in general neither.  So
-- the generators do NOT form a category, and §5 of that file said so.
-- `Weave` below is the reflexive-transitive closure -- the free category
-- on the two families -- which is the smallest honest repair and is
-- what makes composition, and therefore Yoneda, available at all.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED (all `--safe`, no postulates, no holes):
--
--   * `Weave` is a category: identity on both sides, associativity.
--   * `yonedaTo`   : a thread-path induces a transformation of profiles,
--                    and that transformation is NATURAL.
--   * `yonedaFrom` : every natural transformation comes from a path,
--                    namely its value at the identity.
--   * the two round trips: `yonedaFrom ∘ yonedaTo` is the identity on
--     the nose, and `yonedaTo ∘ yonedaFrom` is pointwise the identity
--     on natural transformations.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT.  The round trips give a bijection, not a `≃`: upgrading
-- needs `isSet (Weave i j)` so that naturality is a proposition and two
-- transformations agreeing pointwise are equal.  That is true (Thread is
-- built from equalities in ℕ, which is a set) and it is not proved here.
-- Said plainly because "≃" is what T25.A asks for and this is "↔".
--
-- WHY IT MATTERS HERE.  D0025 §16 is the operative sentence: a local
-- event must propagate through the whole Net by transport/naturality,
-- and §27 identifies the absence of that propagation as the entire
-- failure of the machine work.  Naturality is that propagation, and
-- this file is where it stops being a word.

-- §3  The reflection profile of a jewel
--
-- `Profile j` is D0025 §4's `Map(−, j)`: the assignment sending every
-- jewel to the threads running from it into j.  This is the presheaf
-- the Yoneda statement is about, and it is the exact sense in which a
-- jewel carries "the whole Net as reflected there" -- not a copy of the
-- net, but the totality of the ways into it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Profile : Jewel → Jewel → Type
Profile j i = Weave i j

-- A transformation of profiles, and the naturality that makes it
-- COHERENT in §4's sense: it must commute with pre-composition, i.e.
-- it must not depend on the route by which a jewel reaches the root.

Transformation i j = (k : Jewel) → Profile i k → Profile j k

Natural : {i j : Jewel} → Transformation i j → Type

yoneda-from-to t = refl

-- The other is where naturality does the work.  Instantiating it at the
-- path `p` itself turns "η at p" into "η at the identity, transported
-- along p" -- which is precisely §4's claim that a jewel is determined
-- by how everything maps into it.
yoneda-to-from : {i j : Jewel} (η : Transformation i j) → Natural η

-- §6  The reweave (D0025 §16, T25.F), in the one form available here
--
-- "Suppose a new equivalence is proved, e : x ≃ y.  Univalence supplies
-- ua(e) : x = y.  Every dependent family P transports.  Therefore one
-- local equivalence changes the reflection structure everywhere it is
-- referenced."
--
-- For jewels the identification is a path in `Jewel`, and the statement
-- that the profile follows it is `subst`.  It is one line, and that is
-- the point: in this setting propagation is not machinery to be built,
-- it is what an identification MEANS.  The machine in `machine/` has no
-- such structure, so a proved theorem there can change nothing except
-- the normaliser -- which is the concrete form of §27's complaint.

-- §7  What this does not yet give
--
-- * `≃` rather than `↔`: needs `isSet (Weave i j)`, hence that Naturality
--   is a proposition.  True, unproved here.
--
-- * The composition of the two thread FAMILIES is still free.  Nothing
--   above says that a shared-centre step followed by a shared-radius
--   step is equal to any other path; the net has no relations yet, so
--   `Weave` is a free category and its Yoneda is correspondingly cheap.
--   The relations are where the arithmetic lives, and finding them is
--   the work -- D0025 §12 asks precisely whether the crossings satisfy
--   associator, hexagon, Yang-Baxter, and answers: "Do not infer from
--   the word 'braid'."
--
-- * No tear.  A separator `Sep(x,y)` is supposed to become an object of
--   the theory graph (§16) and a failed gluing is the tear the next
--   stage must repair (§18).  There is no tear type here, and until
--   there is, nothing in this development can be FORCED to extend
--   itself -- which is the difference between a net and a notation.
