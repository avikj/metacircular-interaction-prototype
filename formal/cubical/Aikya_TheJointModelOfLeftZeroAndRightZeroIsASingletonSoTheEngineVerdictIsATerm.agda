-- ऐक्य — forced oneness.  (Term used descriptively — aikya, "unity/
-- identity", classical Sanskrit; no source-text claim is made for the
-- mathematics, which is elementary and stated everywhere.  The compound
-- file name was built here.)

-- WHAT THIS IS.  machinery/crystal/'s engine issued IMPOSSIBLE for the
-- identity-map interpretation between the theories `left-zero`
-- (x·y = x) and `right-zero` (x·y = y): completion of the joint theory
-- collapses the carrier, and models.py confirmed by finite search that
-- every joint model on domains of size 2 and 3 is trivial (36/36 run,
-- commit 0b2f6850).  Both of those are testimony — a Python run a
-- reader must trust.  This module is the same verdict as PERCEPTION:
-- a kernel-checked term, for every carrier and every size at once.
--
-- Per notes/DosaLekha_TheCrystalEngineDuplicatesCheckedTermsAndThe
-- DefectIsNowPriced.md (receipt R2): one verdict transported converts
-- the engine from parallel authority to conjecture generator.  This is
-- that transport.  The engine PROPOSED; the kernel now DISPOSES.
--
-- Statement.  If one binary operation on a type satisfies both the
-- left-zero law and the right-zero law, the type is a proposition:
-- any two points are equal.  Consequently no such operation exists on
-- Bool (or any type with two distinguishable points) — the finite
-- searches at sizes 2 and 3 were shadows of this one term.
