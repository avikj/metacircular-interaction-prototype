-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- D0025 §16 and §18, D0016 §B and §C: the tear as an OBJECT, and Γ as
-- the operation that makes the next stage's material out of it.
--
-- §16:  a separator "becomes a new object/cell in the theory graph".
-- §18:  "a failed gluing condition is exactly the tear that the next
--        Braid stage must repair."
-- D0016 §C:  Γ_α : 𝒪_α → Cell(𝒞_{α+1}), attached along ∂𝒪_α, with
--        ∂Γ⟨δ⁽ⁿ⁾⟩ = δ⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾, and §I: "the boundary is the womb of the
--        successor form".
--
-- This is the operation whose absence is the whole complaint in §27,
-- and the concrete form of it in `machine/MathMachine.hs` is that a
-- round refuted 9,001 conjectures and failed to prove 34,320 and
-- DELETED all 43,321, keeping 30 successes.  Every one of those was a
-- witnessed distinction.  A machine that keeps only what succeeded is
-- accumulating jewels; the material of the next stage is what tore.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE.  That this net actually tears -- not as a
-- possibility, as an exhibited term.  Each thread family carries an
-- invariant BY DEFINITION (a shared-centre thread is a proof that the
-- centres agree), and the composite of the two families carries
-- NEITHER.  Concrete jewels are given and the disagreement is proved,
-- not asserted.  Then Γ takes a tear to a jewel, so the next stage's
-- material is produced by the failure rather than chosen from a menu --
-- which is the exact difference between this and the machine's `GROW`,
-- where running dry takes the next symbol off a hard-coded list.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  §5's equation is `refl` by construction.  Its
-- content is that Γ is DEFINED from the defect; the proof is nothing
-- and saying otherwise would be dressing a definition as a theorem.

-- §4  The tear as an object
--
-- A tear is not the absence of a proof.  It is a POSITIVE datum: two
-- jewels, a weave that really connects them, an observable that really
-- disagrees, and the size of the disagreement.  That last field is what
-- makes it generative rather than merely a complaint -- D0016 §B's
-- defect δ_σ = 𝔥_σ ⊖ 1 is a difference, and a difference has a size.
--
-- The gap is written additively (`gapWitness`) so that no truncated
-- subtraction enters, the discipline `EGBPairConic` fixed for this net.

-- §5  Γ: the successor form, born from the boundary
--
-- "सीमा = उत्तररूपस्य योनिः."  Γ sends a tear to a jewel of the next
-- stage: the one centred where the weave started, with the DEFECT as
-- its radius.  So the new material is a function of the failure and of
-- nothing else -- no menu, no list of symbols to widen to.
--
-- The equation below is `refl`.  It is stated anyway because it is the
-- one thing that has to be true of Γ for the construction to mean what
-- §C says: the generated cell REMEMBERS the defect it came from
-- (∂Γ⟨δ⟩ = δ).  Its proof is nothing; its content is the definition.

-- §6  What this does not yet do
--
-- * It does not REPAIR.  §18 says the tear is what the next stage must
--   repair; Γ here produces the successor material and says nothing
--   about gluing it back.  The repair is the coherence cell, and it is
--   not written.
--
-- * The tear exhibited is one term, not a classification.  Which pairs
--   of jewels tear, and by how much, is an arithmetic question about
--   this net -- and it is the first question in this development whose
--   answer is not bookkeeping.
--
-- * Nothing iterates.  Γ produces a jewel; a stage is a whole net; the
--   step from one to the other is D0016 §E's 𝔉, and the thing that
--   makes 𝔉 a Braid rather than a loop is 𝔉_{α+1} ≢ 𝔉_α.  Nothing here
--   changes its own law yet, and until it does this is still a notation
--   that tears rather than a machine that weaves.
