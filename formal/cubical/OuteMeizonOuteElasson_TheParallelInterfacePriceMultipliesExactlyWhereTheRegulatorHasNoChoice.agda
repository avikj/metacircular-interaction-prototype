------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ON THE NAME.  **No Sanskrit term is claimed and none is invented**, per
-- CLAUDE.md's file-naming rule, note 2.  The method this module formalises
-- is Greek and the file leads with the source's own words for it.
--
-- Archimedes' quadratures close by eliminating both inequalities: the
-- magnitude sought is shown to be neither GREATER (μεῖζον, *meizon*) nor
-- LESS (ἔλασσον, *elasson*) than the asserted value, therefore equal.  That
-- two-sided elimination is the whole of the demonstration, and its shape is
-- what §5 below checks.
--
-- WHAT IS CLAIMED OF THE GREEK SOURCES.  Only this: the double elimination
-- is their argument form, and it consumes a hypothesis that the bracket can
-- be driven below any assigned magnitude — Eudoxus' admission condition
-- (Euclid, *Elements* V, def. 4) acting through the bisection lemma
-- (*Elements* X.1).
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Neither Eudoxus nor Archimedes said anything about
-- relations, interfaces, covers or regulators.  The covering mathematics in
-- §§1–4 is NOT Greek; its statement of record here is the owner
-- transmission quoted below, and the lower bound cited in §5 is linear
-- programming duality.
--
-- "Method of exhaustion" is not a Greek phrase either.  It is Grégoire de
-- Saint-Vincent's coinage, *Opus geometricum*, 1647 — a 17th-century Latin
-- name for a 4th-century-BCE Greek argument.  Repo-wide, the later name has
-- displaced the sources.  Grep over `notes/` before writing this file, for
-- the TEXT's name and not the author's:

--
-- TRANSMISSION, named because the sibling module carrying it in full landed
-- the same hour and this one must not re-land it:
-- `LogonEchein_TheArchimedeanConditionIsIndependentOfOrderAdditionAndALeastPositive.agda`
-- records the chain — 10th-c. Byzantine copy, scraped and overwritten as a
-- euchologion signed 14 April 1229, undertext identified by Johan Ludvig
-- Heiberg at the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre, Constantinople, 1906,
-- published 1906–1913, sold at Christie's New York 29 October 1998,
-- multispectral and synchrotron imaging at the Walters Art Museum
-- 1999–2008.  Read it there.  What is used here is the *Method*'s own
-- preface: the mechanical procedure supplies the result and does NOT
-- demonstrate it (οὐκ ἀποδεδειγμένον).  Two stages, and §5 is the second.
--
-- THE OTHER-DIRECTION SEARCH, REPORTED PLAINLY AS A NEGATIVE.  Established
-- today by cf-tessera-i-0 and not re-derived: the Śulba-sūtras, the Jaina
-- *Anuyogadvāra* / *Sthānāṅga*, and Piṅgala/Halāyudha carry no signed
-- incidence structure and no difference-of-endpoints operator, and "the
-- meru-prastāra's rule is a summation along a graded DAG, not a signed
-- difference across an undirected edge."  I ran the adjacent question for
-- THIS module's object — a MINIMUM transversal of a family of witness sets,
-- and its behaviour under parallel composition — and it comes back empty
-- too.  *Anuyogadvāra* and *Sthānāṅga* enumerate *bhaṅga* combinations and
-- Piṅgala's *prastāra* generates an array by rule; neither poses a
-- minimisation over subsets subject to a covering constraint, which is what
-- κ₀ is.  A reported negative is a result and I do not manufacture a use
-- for one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE OWNER TRANSMISSION THIS MODULE CHECKS.
--
-- `collab/upstream/library/raw/SUFFICIENT_INTERFACES_DELTA_02_2026-08-13.md`,
-- quoted, not paraphrased:
--
--   §0  "Strict submultiplicativity already occurs in the smallest
--        interesting symmetric example. This means jointly solving two
--        independent relational tasks can require fewer interface states
--        than separately minimizing and multiplying their interfaces."
--
--   §3  "The interface is not required to factor as q1×q2. This
--        correlation produces compression."
--
--   §7  "This distinguishes: exact state reconstruction; exact
--        deterministic target reconstruction; relational witness
--        realization.  Only the third has selector freedom large enough for
--        the triangle compression above."
--
--   §8  "The invariant κ0 is submultiplicative under tensor:
--        κ0(R⊗S)≤κ0(R)κ0(S), but not multiplicative."
--
--   §10 "LIVE FRONTIER: Prove or disprove G∞=0 for finite witness
--        hypergraphs under unrestricted block selectors."
--
-- Delta 02's Theorem 1 (κ₀ = 2) and Theorem 2 (κ₀ of the square = 3 < 4)
-- are the owner's.  §2 below re-derives them as checked terms so §§3–6 can
-- stand on them; the credit is his.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE TWO LENSES, AND WHERE THEY SPLIT.
--
-- ASHBY: a regulator must have at least as much variety as what it
-- regulates.  The NUMBER a designer takes from that law: to regulate two
-- tasks in parallel you need the product of the two varieties,
-- κ₀(R⊗S) = κ₀(R)·κ₀(S).
--
-- DIRAC: follow the formal beauty of the equation past what is currently
-- justified.  The beautiful invariant here is the fractional cover value
-- τ*, which Delta 02's Theorem 4 proves EXACTLY multiplicative; the
-- integral κ₀ is a discretisation artefact; hence K∞ = log τ*, G∞ = 0, and
-- Delta 02's own §10 frontier resolves by beauty.
--
-- They disagree about one finite number: κ₀ of the triangle squared.
-- Ashby's number says 4.  Dirac's says track τ*² = 9/4, hence 3.
--
-- VERDICT, in three parts because the material splits it in three:
--
--   §2  DIRAC WINS ON THE FINITE FACT.  Ashby's number is refuted by a
--       checked term — three interface states suffice for the squared task,
--       so the price is not 4.  `ashby-number-refuted`.
--
--   §3–§4  DIRAC LOSES ON THE EXTRAPOLATION HE WINS BY.  "Selector freedom,
--       hence compression" is false as stated.  §3 proves generically that
--       where the witness is FORCED the price multiplies exactly; §4 states
--       MY OWN strengthening of that — freedom anywhere gives compression —
--       and kills it with a checked counterexample.
--
--   §5  ARCHIMEDES REFUSES G∞ = 0.  At n = 4 the transmission's own bracket
--       is [6, 9] and does not shrink.  A double elimination yields equality
--       only from a bracket drivable below any assigned magnitude.
--       `G∞-is-not-decided-by-this-bracket` is that refusal, checked.
--
-- ASHBY'S LAW SURVIVES, HIS NUMBER DOES NOT — the correction already landed
-- as `NaturalMachine/Prastara_TheGaugeStreamCostsZeroCarriedBitsAndInvisibilityIsWeakerThanGauge.agda`
-- (cf-tessera-j-1, 2026-08-20): the correct price is the image of the
-- disturbance set under the evaluation, not its cardinality.  Not re-landed
-- here.  §3 adds where the cardinality answer IS right: a relation whose
-- witness is forced offers the selector nothing to correlate, and there the
-- two prices coincide.  The law prices choice.
--
-- §6's negative is written in the positive-data idiom of the drawn module
-- `NaturalMachine/FormationDirectionIncidence.agda`, whose §4 says of its
-- own `ExposureBound`: "It is positive data, not the negation of a missed
-- search."  `FactorBound` here has that shape and is refuted the same way.

-- 4.  REFUTATION OF MY OWN CLAIM.
--
-- CLAIM M, which I held after §§2–3 and which is the Dirac reading pushed
-- one step past the transmission:
--
--   "Compression is exactly the presence of choice.  §3 shows the price
--    multiplies when the witness is forced; §2 shows it drops when it is
--    not; therefore κ₀(R ⊗ R) < κ₀(R)² whenever some input has two or more
--    valid witnesses."
--
-- It is false, and the counterexample is small.  Take
--
--   A = {γ₁, γ₂},  B = {u, v, z},  R(γ₁) = {u, v},  R(γ₂) = {z}.
--
-- γ₁ has genuine choice, so Claim M predicts strict compression.  But the
-- four required witness sets of the squared task,
--
--   {u,v}×{u,v},   {u,v}×{z},   {z}×{u,v},   {z}×{z},
--
-- are PAIRWISE DISJOINT, so four states are forced and κ₀ = 4 = 2·2
-- exactly.  Ashby's number is right here in spite of the choice.
--
-- WHAT KILLED IT.  Choice AT an input is not choice ACROSS inputs.  The
-- triangle's compression in §2 needs two different inputs whose witness
-- sets OVERLAP, so one product state can serve different coordinate-pairs
-- under a correlated selector.  Here the two witness sets are disjoint, the
-- selector has nothing to correlate, and the local freedom at γ₁ is
-- invisible to the product.  Local non-determinism is necessary for
-- compression and is not sufficient.
--
-- Delta 02 §7 already says "selector freedom LARGE ENOUGH"; Claim M dropped
-- the qualifier, and the qualifier was carrying the theorem.
