--                  AndTheTwoSchoolsFourthPositionsSitAtDifferentLevels
--
-- TWO SCHOOLS APPEAR IN THIS FILE.  THEY REJECT EACH OTHER'S CATEGORIES
-- AND THEY ARE NOT MERGED INTO ONE TOOLKIT.  §1 is Jaina, §2 is Bauddha,
-- and §3 states a claim ABOUT THE TWO FORMALISATIONS -- not about what
-- either tradition really means.
--
-- TERM (JAINA).  निरपेक्ष · nirapekṣa -- without reference, absolute, said
-- of an assertion made with no upādhi; against सापेक्ष · sāpekṣa, made with
-- one.  The Jaina rule is that a नय · naya asserted nirapekṣa becomes a
-- दुर्नय · durnaya.  Siddhasena Divākara, *Sanmatitarka*; developed by
-- Akalaṅka (~8th c.).  No first use of the pair is established here.
--
-- AND A WARNING THIS REPOSITORY'S OWN LEDGER RECORDS, HEEDED: three
-- separate corrections have landed on the word अवक्तव्य · avaktavya in this
-- corpus, one of them because a line named for it actually sat at the
-- THIRD bhaṅga.  So, said plainly: §1 exhibits bhaṅgas ONE and TWO
-- (syād-asti, syād-nāsti) and the KRAMA reading of the THIRD -- both, in
-- succession.  IT DOES NOT EXHIBIT THE FOURTH.  The fourth arises from
-- युगपत् · yugapat, simultaneous assertion, and is not what is proved here.
--
-- TERM (BAUDDHA).  चतुष्कोटि · catuṣkoṭi -- the four corners, standard in
-- Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (~2nd c. CE).  §2 formalises the
-- FOURTH corner as ¬ (A ⊎ ¬ A) with प्रसज्यप्रतिषेध · prasajya-pratiṣedha,
-- the non-implicative negation -- the reading on which the negation
-- asserts nothing positive, which is `A → ⊥`.  The distinction from
-- पर्युदास · paryudāsa, the implicative negation, is drawn by Westerhoff in
-- the modern literature; it is a reading and I mark it as one.  UNDER
-- PARYUDĀSA THE FOURTH CORNER IS A DIFFERENT FORMULA AND §2 DOES NOT
-- APPLY TO IT.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF EITHER SOURCE.  No Jaina and no Bauddha
-- proved anything below.  Nothing here interprets the *Sanmatitarka* or
-- the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- PRIOR ART, SEARCHED BEFORE WRITING RATHER THAN AFTER.
--
-- Formal treatments of both exist and are contested.  Priest and Ganeri
-- read the saptabhaṅgī as supporting a non-classical (many-valued/modal)
-- system; Balcerowicz contests that reading.  Priest and Garfield read the
-- catuṣkoṭi paraconsistently, via FDE and a plurivalent extension, and
-- WOULD NOT ACCEPT §2's flat refutation of the fourth corner -- on their
-- reading it is assertable.  Schang treats the saptabhaṅgī and the
-- catuṣkoṭi within ONE common framework.
--
-- §3 DISAGREES WITH SCHANG, and the disagreement is the file's point: the
-- two fourth positions are not two settings of one dial.  What would
-- refute §3 is a single formal setting in which the Jaina fourth and the
-- Bauddha fourth are the same construction; I claim there is none, and
-- exhibit the difference rather than argue it.
--
-- I did not find published work formalising either doctrine in a proof
-- assistant or in type theory.  That is a report on a search made from
-- this environment, not a claim that none exists.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT IS PROVED.
--
--   §1  asti, nasti, and then BOTH unqualified forms refuted:
--         no-unqualified-assertion, no-unqualified-denial.
--       So the qualified forms are not a weakening of an available
--       absolute one.  There is no absolute one, in either direction.
--       AND THIS IS NOT A CONTRADICTION: it is the ordinary condition of
--       a family over `Env` whose fibers disagree.  Contingent on the
--       pair, and false for pairs the calculus does derive.
--
--   §2  no-fourth-corner : ¬ (¬ (A ⊎ ¬ A)), for EVERY A, at every level,
--       depending on nothing.  A theorem of logic, not a fact about an
--       object.
--
--   §3  THE CONTRAST, which is the claim.  §1 is contingent, about one
--       family, and consistent.  §2 is universal, about no family, and a
--       refutation.  A doctrine whose fourth position is §1's shape and a
--       doctrine whose fourth position is §2's shape are not variants of
--       one logic: the first lives in the dependency of a type on an
--       index, the second in the propositional structure of negation.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT PROVED, named:
--   * NOT the Jaina fourth bhaṅga.  See the warning above.  Formalising
--     avaktavya needs the yugapat reading and it is not attempted here.
--   * NO claim that either formalisation is the right reading of its
--     tradition.  §3 is about the two formal objects.
--   * NO engagement with the paraconsistent alternative on its own
--     ground; §2 is constructive and Priest and Garfield are not.
--
-- CHECKED.  Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5, `--safe`, no postulates, no holes,
-- exit 0 at the previous module path.  Module name and imports were renamed
-- to `Kernel.*` to match this directory; that rename has not been re-run at
-- the repository pin (2.8.0 + v0.9).
