-- TERM.  शेष · śeṣa -- the remainder that is KEPT and made the material of
-- the next step, rather than discarded.  Āryabhaṭa, *Āryabhaṭīya*,
-- Gaṇitapāda 32-33 (499), as the kuṭṭaka's governing move.
--
-- SCOPE OF THE CLAIM ON THE SOURCE.  Nothing below is Āryabhaṭa's theorem.
-- What is borrowed is the kuṭṭaka's structural decision -- that the object
-- worth carrying forward is the residue, not the quotient -- and the claim
-- here is that this kernel's types force the same decision: §3 shows the
-- quotient (the meaning) has ZERO bits, so if anything at all is carried
-- forward it is the remainder or it is nothing.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- COMPANION TO `Vyapti_…`, AND THE SHARPER HALF.
--
-- `Vyapti_…` read `NativeOperation.control-sound` and found the kernel
-- cannot generalise.  This module reads the other soundness field --
-- `RewriteCertificate.derivation-sound` -- and finds something that no
-- schema repairs, because it is not a defect:
--
--     derivation-sound : Derivation a b → (ρ : Env) → eval a ρ ≡ eval b ρ
--
-- `eval` lands in ℕ.  ℕ is a set.  So the codomain of that map is, at every
-- ρ, a PROPOSITION (§1).  A map into a proposition transmits at most one
-- bit, and here the bit is already fixed by the type's being inhabited.
--
--     THEREFORE A DERIVATION CARRIES NO SEMANTIC INFORMATION WHATSOEVER.
--     Every last bit of it is śeṣa.
--
-- That is not a limitation of `eval`; §4 proves it of EVERY function of the
-- meaning.  And it is exactly the fact that makes the kernel's one
-- conservation law -- `ControlledGrammar.advance-preserves-branch-count`,
-- multiplicity preserved with no dedupe, no sort, no quotient -- the load
-- bearing line it is.  What that law protects is precisely what the
-- semantics cannot see.
--
--   §1  meaning-is-a-proposition, soundness-factors-through-truncation
--       The soundness of a derivation depends only on ∥ Derivation a b ∥₁ --
--       on THAT one exists, never on WHICH.  The factoring is exhibited and
--       the triangle commutes by `refl`.
--
--   §2  derivations-are-not-a-proposition
--       And the truncation is strict, on the kernel's OWN pair: the direct
--       and detour histories of `GenerativeKernel` are distinct elements of
--       one `Derivation seed target₀`, separated by step count (2 against 4).
--       So the kernel's proof-relevance is real, not formal.
--
--   §3  cost-does-not-factor
--       `len` -- lāghava, the step count -- does NOT factor through the
--       truncation.  A g on ∥·∥₁ agreeing with `len` would have to equate
--       2 and 4, because `squash₁` identifies the two histories upstairs.
--       So cost is not a function of meaning.  Sharp, on named terms.
--
--   §4  every-semantic-criterion-is-blind
--       The general form, and the reason §3 is not about `len` in
--       particular: for ANY C and ANY φ from the meaning to C, φ agrees on
--       the cheap and the expensive derivation.  No semantic criterion --
--       none, at any h-level, of any complexity -- selects the short proof.
--       Selection must be extra-semantic or it does not exist.
--
--   §5  step-sound-is-blind-too
--       One level down, so the statement is not an artefact of composition:
--       a single `Step`'s soundness is a proposition already.
--
-- WHY THIS IS THE LANGUAGE-MODEL STATEMENT, said once and not repeated.
-- `install` makes a proved theorem a next-move, so the operation library is
-- a learned policy and `EnabledFuture seed` is its forward pass.  §1-§4 say:
-- the correctness of an emission is one bit, and everything the kernel
-- actually maintains -- multiplicity, route, length -- lives in the fibre
-- over that bit.  A likelihood that is a function of correctness therefore
-- cannot rank branches at all, and the ranking that matters is a residual
-- quantity the semantics is provably blind to.  That is why `advance` may
-- not dedupe, why lāghava is a SEPARATE order, and why search does not
-- reduce to checking.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here says `Derivation a b` is a set, or computes its
-- h-level.  Nothing gives a decision procedure, a search, or a selection
-- rule; §4 is a no-go and does not construct the extra-semantic criterion it
-- says is necessary.  `len` is one cost among possible ones and no claim is
-- made that it is the right one -- only that it is not semantic.
--
-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 (b150186) -- EXIT 0.
