-- Kernel.TrtiyaSopana_TheInductionCertificateDoesNotReach
--            CommutativitySoTheHierarchyHasThreeStrictLevels
--
-- तृतीय-सोपानम् · the third step of the stair.  The compound is assembled
-- here for this module and no textual source is claimed for it.
--
-- WHERE THIS STANDS.  `Naya_…` proved two things and left one question
-- between them, named in its own WHAT-IS-NOT-PROVED block by omission:
--
--   §3 there   commutativity of `add` is UNDERIVABLE          (W-model)
--   §4 there   the induction rule is STRICTLY STRONGER than
--              the rewrite closure                            (0 + x = x)
--
-- Open between them: whether the induction apparatus — the strongest
-- thing in the kernel's three files — reaches commutativity.  This
-- module answers: IT DOES NOT.  The same W-standpoint that decided §3
-- decides this, one level up, with no new machinery: an
-- `InductionCertificate (add var yvar) (add yvar var)` carries a `base`
-- field of type `Derivation (add zero yvar) (add yvar zero)`, and the
-- W-values of those endpoints differ at the head —
--
--     ⟦ add zero yvar ⟧ = aM ∷ aY ∷ []        (the marker survives)
--     ⟦ add yvar zero ⟧ = aY ∷ []             (right unit, by refl)
--
-- so `derivation-model` refutes the base, hence the certificate.
--
-- THE CONSEQUENCE, stated as one object below.  Commutativity is TRUE at
-- every environment (`+-comm`), certifiable by nothing the kernel has,
-- installable a fortiori by nothing the kernel has.  With `Naya_…`'s §4
-- this closes a three-level strictness:
--
--     rewrite closure  ⊊  induction closure  ⊊  truth in ℕ
--
-- first strictness witnessed by `0 + x = x` (there), second by
-- `x + y = y + x` (here).  The kernel certifies more than it can
-- install, and there is truth it cannot even certify.
--
-- WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE APPARATUS, read forward not backward: the
-- certificate form does induction on ONE coordinate (`var`), and
-- commutativity's classical proof needs a nested induction whose base
-- `0 + y = y` is itself only induction-certifiable — but `base` demands
-- a `Derivation`, and by `Naya_…`'s `not-left-unital` argument none
-- exists.  The wall is exactly the type of the `base` field.  A
-- certificate whose base may itself be a certificate is the repair this
-- names and does not make; whether to make it is a design decision and
-- is not taken here.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No completeness for the two-level closure, no
-- claim that deeper nesting exhausts ℕ-truth (Gödel forbids exhausting
-- it by any effective closure), no repair, no design change.  One
-- certificate type is refuted at one pair of endpoints; the positive
-- half is `+-comm` at every environment, and the pair is the theorem.
--
-- CHECKED at the repository pin, --safe, no postulates, no holes.
