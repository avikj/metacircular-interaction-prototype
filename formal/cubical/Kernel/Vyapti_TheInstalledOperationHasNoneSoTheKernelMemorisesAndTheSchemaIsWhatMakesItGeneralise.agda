--
-- TERM.  व्याप्ति · vyāpti -- pervasion: the invariable concomitance that
-- makes an inference carry from the case at hand to every case of the same
-- mark.  Root notion in Gautama, *Nyāyasūtra* (~2nd c. CE), under अनुमान;
-- the definitional apparatus (the vyāptivāda, and the उपाधि that defeats a
-- proposed pervasion) is Navya-Nyāya, Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi* (~1325).
-- The 12-century gap is stated because filing the later apparatus under the
-- sūtrakāra is the error this corpus struck in its own Pāṇini row.
--
-- SCOPE OF THE CLAIM ON THE SOURCE.  Naming this module for vyāpti does NOT
-- say the Naiyāyikas proved anything below.  What is borrowed is one
-- distinction they drew sharply and that this kernel's types do not: a
-- मार्क that licenses an inference ONLY in the instance where it was
-- observed is not a pervasion at all.  §1 shows the kernel's installed
-- operation is exactly such a mark, and the type forces it.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
--
-- `ControlledGrammar.NativeOperation` is the kernel's unit of learned
-- behaviour, and `install : Derivation lhs rhs → NativeOperation` is how a
-- theorem the machine proved becomes a move the machine can make.  That is
-- the metacircular step: proofs become the generative library, so the
-- library at a context is a next-move distribution, kept without quotient
-- (`advance-preserves-branch-count`) and carrying its derivation.
--
-- The library IS the retrieval structure and `Control` IS the match.  So the
-- question "what does this kernel generalise over?" is answered by the type
-- of `control-sound`, and the answer is: NOTHING.
--
--   §1  fires-only-at-source, enabled-set-is-subsingleton, output-is-constant
--       Every installed operation fires at exactly one term, up to a path,
--       and emits a fixed target.  A NativeOperation is a single key/value
--       pair.  The kernel is a lookup table and `control-sound`'s type is
--       what makes it one -- this is not a property of the current library.
--
--   §2  covered-heights-are-library-heights, kernel-cannot-reach-a-tower
--       Consequently the coverage of a whole library is finite while `Tm` is
--       not: the heights of the terms a library can fire on are literally
--       the finitely many heights of its sources.  Exhibited on the kernel's
--       OWN library (`GenerativeKernel.run`'s two operations, whose common
--       source is `add var (suc zero)`): the term `suc (suc (suc zero))` has
--       no enabled future, so `form` returns [] there and the generative
--       loop has nothing to do.
--
--   §3  SchematicOperation, schematic-fires-at-every-instance,
--       one-schema-two-contexts, no-native-operation-does-this
--       The repair, and the point of the module: an operation whose control
--       carries a SUBSTITUTION WITNESS rather than an identification with a
--       fixed source.  Its soundness is not a new axiom and not a new proof
--       obligation -- `eval-subVar` and the schema's own meaning discharge
--       it, both already in `RewriteCertificate`.  So GENERALISATION IS FREE
--       IN THIS CALCULUS AND MEMORISATION IS WHAT COSTS: one schematic
--       operation covers a `Tm`-indexed family of contexts, and §3's last
--       theorem shows no NativeOperation whatsoever covers even two of them.
--
--   §4  every-substitution-is-enabled, all-collapse-to-one-output
--       The fibre reading, which is why the substitution witness may not be
--       thrown away.  `apply` does not consume `u`.  For a schema whose
--       left-hand side contains no `var`, the enabled set at its one context
--       is a whole copy of `Tm` and every member emits the same output: the
--       fibre over an emission is infinite.  `GenerativeKernel.run-targets`
--       exhibits the two-element case of this (two histories, one target);
--       here it is unbounded.  Collapsing that fibre is the loss the carrier
--       law prices, and the reason `advance` refuses to dedupe.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  No decision procedure for `Control` is given, so nothing
-- here is a matcher; §3 exhibits instances and does not search for them.
-- Nothing here scores, ranks or samples the enabled list -- there is no
-- policy, and `Uttara`'s prohibition on a bare verdict is untouched.  The
-- schematic operation substitutes for ONE variable (`var`, via `subVar`),
-- which is the only substitution `RewriteCertificate` defines; the other
-- five coordinates of `Env` are not schematic here.
--
-- Checked at the pin: Agda 2.8.0, agda/cubical v0.9 (b150186) -- EXIT 0.
