-- Antya — one anubandha carries every fresh-start suffix of its stretch.
-- A whole ⊆-chain of classes costs ONE marker, for chains of any length,
-- over any alphabet.  The reason under Dviḥpāṭha's exhaustion.
--
-- SOURCE.  Pāṇini, *Aṣṭādhyāyī* 1.1.71, ādir antyena sahetā: the initial
-- (ādi), taken together with the final (antya) which is an it, denotes
-- itself and what lies between.  The marker is the *antya*.  This file is
-- about how much ONE antya can denote.
--
-- WHAT CALLED THIS FILE.  `Dvihpatha_TheAntichainBoundIsAttainedOnlyIf-
-- ASoundMayBeListedTwice.agda` settles a five-class family by checking all
-- 120 arrangements: ⊆-width two, cost three recited-once, cost two once a
-- sound may be recited twice.  That is an instance and it is decided, but
-- an exhaustion says nothing about a sixth class or a fourth sound.  The
-- general fact it is an instance of is here, and it needs no enumeration:
--
--   §3  `स्वच्छादिः-अन्त्येन` — for any alphabet A with a boolean equality
--       reflexive on the diagonal, any stretch written `p ++ s ∷ q` and
--       any marker m fresh in that stretch:  if s does not recur in q,
--       then `klass s m` returns exactly `s ∷ q`.
--
--   So EVERY suffix of the stretch whose first sound does not recur later
--   in the stretch is a class of the single marker m.  A stretch with n
--   such positions gives n classes on one antya, and they are nested by
--   construction — each is a suffix of the next — which is
--   `PratyaharaLaghava.sharedEnd→comparable` arriving again from the other
--   side.  A ⊆-chain of length n costs one marker, not n.
--
--   §4  the two hypotheses are each load-bearing, shown by a term:
--       recurrence of s inside q moves the answer to a later block
--       (`स्वच्छत्वं-आवश्यकम्`), and a marker occurring earlier truncates
--       the stretch (`अन्त्यस्य-स्वच्छत्वम्`).  Neither is decoration.
--
--   §5  the general extractor at A := Dviḥpāṭha's Sym IS Dviḥpāṭha's
--       extractor, pointwise (`समानम्`), so §3 applies to the checked
--       instance and does not merely resemble it.  §6 reads that instance
--       back through §3: the two-marker twice-recited line is two stretches
--       carrying a 3-chain and a 2-chain, and §3 predicts all five classes
--       with no enumeration.
--
-- WHAT THIS SETTLES, and it is the point of the file.  With repetition
-- unrestricted, a family covered by w chains is named by w markers: lay
-- each chain's stretch down in order, close it with its own antya, and §3
-- delivers that chain's whole nesting from that one antya.  Since sounds
-- may recur across stretches and §3 asks only for freshness WITHIN a
-- stretch, the stretches never interfere.  With Dilworth's theorem —
-- CITED, not proved here, and not proved anywhere in this repository —
-- chain-cover number equals ⊆-width, and `PratyaharaLaghava.markersDistinct`
-- gives the matching lower bound.  So the antichain bound is exactly the
-- answer when repetition is free, and the entire content of the
-- śiva-sūtra problem is the economy of repetition.  Pāṇini's line recites
-- one sound twice.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** PROVED HERE, said plainly because the paragraph above is
-- the kind that gets quoted without its qualifications:
--
--   * Dilworth's theorem.  Cited.  The construction above gives markers ≤
--     chain-cover number; turning that into markers ≤ width needs it.
--   * The construction over an arbitrary family as a single checked term.
--     §3 is the per-chain step, fully general; assembling n stretches for
--     n chains is a fold over a list of chains and is not written here.
--     What is written is the step that does the work and the instance §6
--     where the assembly is exhibited concretely.
--   * μ_k for 0 < k < ∞ — the minimum over lines with at most k
--     twice-recited sounds.  Dviḥpāṭha gives μ₀ = 3, μ₁ = 2 on its family;
--     §3 gives μ_∞ = width in general.  The graded middle is OPEN and it
--     is where Pāṇini's line actually sits: 42 sounds, k = 1, 14 markers.
--   * Petersen 2004.  Still owed, still unread; egress is blocked here.
--   * Any claim that Pāṇini stated this.  He stated 1.1.71 and the line.
--
-- DUPLICATION, declared.  `prefixBefore` / `suffixFromLast` / `klass` are
-- restated here over an abstract alphabet rather than imported, because
-- Dviḥpāṭha's are monomorphic in its own `Sym`.  §5 proves the two agree
-- pointwise, so this is a generalisation and not a fork.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.
