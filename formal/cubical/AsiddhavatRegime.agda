-- AsiddhavatRegime — the two regimes are different devices, at the site
-- where the difference is visible.
--
-- THE TWO SŪTRAS, checked against sources 2026-08-19 rather than recalled.
-- Pāṇini, Aṣṭādhyāyī, c. 500 BCE:
--
--   8.2.1  पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्   any SUBSEQUENT rule is asiddha with respect to
--          any rule that PRECEDES it, so the tripādī applies strictly in
--          the order enumerated.  One-way, backwards blindness.
--
--   6.4.22 असिद्धवदत्राभात्  heads 6.4.22–6.4.129: a change by any rule of
--          that section counts as NOT HAVING TAKEN EFFECT when applying
--          any OTHER rule of the same section.  Mutual invisibility; the
--          rules apply AS IF SIMULTANEOUSLY.
--
-- `Asiddhatva.agda` proves the first buys TERMINATION.
-- `NaturalMachine/AsiddhatvaBreaksFactoring.agda` proves the simultaneous
-- device buys INFORMATION (its header attributes that to 8.2.1; the
-- correction is appended there).  What neither shows is that the choice
-- CHANGES THE ANSWER.  This does, at one site, with both regimes computed
-- from the same rule set rather than written down.
--
-- THE SITE is `tat + jalam`, pada-final t before j.  Three rules of the
-- tripādī offer at that one position, and under simultaneity none of them
-- sees the others:
--
--   8.2.39  झलां जशोऽन्ते      jhaL → jaŚ at pada-end        t ↦ d
--   8.4.40  स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः   stu → ścu in contact with ścu  t ↦ c, d ↦ j
--   8.4.53  झलां जश् झशि       jhaL → jaŚ before jhaŚ        t ↦ d
--
-- ORDERED:      8.2.39 fires, then 8.4.40 acts on ITS output.  t → d → j.
--               `tajjalam`, which is the attested form.
-- SIMULTANEOUS: all three see t; 1.4.2 विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम् takes the
--               latest, 8.4.53, and the pass stops.  t → d.  `tadjalam`,
--               which Sanskrit does not have.
--
-- So the regime decides the form.  पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् is load-bearing rather
-- than presentational, and it is the ORDERED device — which is independent
-- evidence for the attribution corrected in AsiddhatvaBreaksFactoring,
-- reached from the rules rather than from the sūtra text.
--
-- This is the checked form of the measurement in `machine/Astadhyayi.hs`
-- (`regimeTests`), whose `asiddhavatPass` found it first.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  Both regimes are folds over one
-- `act` table; nothing below states an answer.

-- 4.  The regimes disagree, and the ordered one is the attested Sanskrit.
--
-- Nothing here states an answer: both sides are folds over `act`.

-- 8.2.39 fires, then 8.4.40 acts on its output: t → d → j.  `tajjalam`.
krama-gives-j : krama t ≡ j
krama-gives-j = refl

-- all three see t; 1.4.2 takes 8.4.53, and the pass stops.  `tadjalam`.

isJ : Antya → Bool
isJ j = true
isJ _ = false

-- so the device is load-bearing, not presentational

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 5.  WHY THE SIMULTANEOUS PASS STOPS SHORT, stated as the offers.
--
-- Under सह the three offers against t are 8.2.39 ↦ d, 8.4.40 ↦ c and
-- 8.4.53 ↦ d.  They collide at one position, so exactly one survives, and
-- 1.4.2 picks the latest.  Under क्रम, 8.2.39's output d is then a fresh
-- input that 8.4.40 can read — which is precisely what asiddhatva forbids
-- between the quarters and permits within the sequence.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

three-offers : offers t ≡ (s8-2-39 , d) ∷ (s8-4-40 , c) ∷ (s8-4-53 , d) ∷ []
three-offers = refl

-- and after the first, only one remains — the ordered regime's second step
one-offer-after : offers d ≡ (s8-4-40 , j) ∷ []
one-offer-after = refl

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 6.  AND THE OBVIOUS NEXT CLAIM IS FALSE, so it is recorded rather than
--     left implied.
--
-- Having proved the regimes differ, the tempting extension is that the
-- simultaneous one is defective — that it fails to terminate, or cannot
-- reach the attested form at all.  Neither holds here.  ITERATE सह and it
-- converges, and it converges to the SAME form क्रम gives:
--
--     saha t = d ,  saha d = j ,  saha j = j
--
-- So the difference between the devices at this site is a difference
-- between ONE PASS and a fixpoint, not between reaching the answer and
-- failing to.  That matters for what may be said about 6.4.22: its block
-- applies once, and the single application is where its content lies.  A
-- claim that simultaneity "cannot get there" would be false.
--
-- What survives from §4 is exact and narrower than it sounded: A SINGLE
-- SIMULTANEOUS PASS over these rules does not give the attested form,
-- while the ordered regime does so in one traversal.  पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् is
-- still load-bearing — the tripādī is traversed once, not iterated — but
-- the reason is that ordering buys the right answer IN ONE PASS, not that
-- simultaneity is incapable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

saha-once  : saha t ≡ d
saha-once  = refl

saha-twice : saha (saha t) ≡ j
saha-twice = refl

saha-fixed : saha (saha (saha t)) ≡ saha (saha t)
saha-fixed = refl

-- iterated, the simultaneous regime reaches exactly what the ordered one
-- reaches in a single traversal
saha-converges-to-krama : saha (saha t) ≡ krama t
saha-converges-to-krama = refl
