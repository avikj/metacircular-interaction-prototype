-- छाया — the shadow, and what is actually impossible about it.
--
-- SCOPE.  This module supplies the term that `Primes.Prakasha` asserts in
-- prose and does not contain, and it corrects the assertion in the same
-- act.  944676e4's message says, of the collapse from the witnessed
-- statement to the truncated one: "the collapse ... exists while the
-- reverse provably does not."  The reverse, read as a bare map
-- ∥ A ∥₁ → A, EXISTS whenever A is inhabited, and this file exhibits one.
-- What does not exist is a SECTION — a map that returns the witness it
-- was given.  That is proved below, unconditionally, for any A carrying
-- two distinct elements, and then instantiated at the Goldbach fibre of
-- 10, which carries 3+7 and 5+5.
--
-- TERM.  छाया / *chāyā*, shadow, is `Primes.Prakasha`'s own coinage in
-- this corpus for the truncated form (`G-chaya`), and is carried here for
-- continuity.  It is NOT a sourced technical term and nothing in any
-- tradition is cited for it.  The mathematics is propositional
-- truncation — Voevodsky's h-levels, the substrate this repository names
-- as its one exception — and is claimed for nobody else.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here says Goldbach is true or false.  Nothing
-- here says the untruncated statement is unprovable.  The theorem is
-- about ∥_∥₁ and a fibre with two elements, and the fibre's plurality is
-- the whole of the hypothesis.
