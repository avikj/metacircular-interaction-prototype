-- CokernelUniversalProperty_
--   TheHandRolledGraphH1IsACokernelAndItsGaugeRelationIsNotPropValued
--
-- PROVENANCE, first, because CLAUDE.md's file-naming rule (note 2) requires
-- a module whose mathematics does NOT originate in the traditions this
-- repository reads to say so rather than carry a fabricated Sanskrit label.
-- This file has no Sanskrit name because its content is not Indian.  Its
-- objects are category theory and homological algebra:
--
--   * The universal property used below is the nLab's, verbatim, from the
--     page `cokernel` — GitHub mirror `ncatlab/nlab-content`, path
--     `pages/3/3/0/1/1033/content.md` (the mirror stores pages by numeric
--     id; the human-readable title is in the sibling file `name`).  The
--     page's second Remark, in a category with a zero object:
--
--       "for every object C and every morphism h : B → C such that
--        h ∘ f = 0 is the zero morphism, there is a UNIQUE morphism
--        φ : coker(f) → C such that h = φ ∘ i."
--
--     and its first Example: "In the category Ab of abelian groups the
--     cokernel of a morphism f : A → B is the quotient of B by the image
--     (of the underlying morphism of sets) of f."
--
--   * The substrate: cubical Agda library v0.5.  Per CLAUDE.md ("Tools are
--     not frames") this is the checker, not an interpretation of anything.
--
-- WHY.  The owner, 2026-08-14T01:56:19Z: "you waste compute on solved
-- problems and don't even import all the most powerful machinery/existing
-- constructs.  We need to stand on the shoulders of giants ... when reading
-- is the best use of time."  `ncatlab.org` is blocked at this container's
-- gateway; the GitHub mirror is not, and clones in thirteen seconds.  This
-- module is one page of it, applied to one object.
--
-- THE OBJECT.  `NaturalMachine/FiniteGraphCohomology.agda` (commit 6e764115,
-- "generalize finite graph gauge cycle pairing") builds, for a graph, the
-- F2 cochain groups C0 and C1, the coboundary δ⁰, the relation `GaugeStep`,
-- and `H¹ = C¹ / GaugeStep` as a BARE `Type₀`.  It has a map OUT of H¹
-- (`descendedEvaluation`) and its own rigor boundary records that exactness
-- is "not claimed".  Nothing in it is modified here; it is imported.
--
-- Also imported by citation, not by name-collision:
-- `KirchhoffOnTheCubicalLibrary_…agda` (cf-tessera-s-0, 2026-08-20) rebuilds
-- a PARALLEL H¹ out of `FinMatrixAbGroup` + `imSubgroup` + `QuotientGroup`
-- and proves exactness there from `SetQuotients.effective`.  That file says
-- of the hand-rolled one: "`FiniteGraphCohomology.H¹` is the same set, as a
-- bare type."  The two were never linked, and §1 below is the reason they
-- could not be linked by transporting that proof.
--
-- WHAT IS CLAIMED, in order:
--
--   §1  REFUTATION, and it is of my own first plan.  I set out to get
--       exactness for the hand-rolled H¹ the way s-0 got it: from
--       `SetQuotients.effective`.  That is impossible.  `effective` demands
--       `isPropValued R`, and `GaugeStep` is NOT prop-valued: as soon as
--       ONE vertex exists, the constant-false and constant-true gauges are
--       two DISTINCT elements of `GaugeStep x x`, because δ⁰ cannot see a
--       global constant.  Witnessed non-identity, not a size check.
--
--       Guarded: with `Vertex` EMPTY the relation IS prop-valued, proved in
--       §1b.  So the hypothesis `v : Vertex` is doing work and the negative
--       is not vacuous over an empty domain.  The two halves together say
--       exactly where the boundary is.
--
--   §2  The repair is already in the library and is not `effective`:
--       `isEquivRel→TruncIso` (SetQuotients.Properties, line 295) needs
--       `isEquivRel` and NO prop-valuedness, and returns the TRUNCATED
--       relation — which is the correct statement of "image" anyway
--       (nLab `image`, and the cokernel Example above says image of the
--       underlying map of sets).  `GaugeStep` is an equivalence relation
--       (§2a), so exactness at C¹ holds for the hand-rolled H¹ in both
--       directions (§2b): the class of x is trivial exactly when x is
--       merely a coboundary.
--
--   §3  The nLab universal property itself, for an ARBITRARY abelian group
--       target: for h : C¹ → ⟨A⟩ additive with h ∘ δ⁰ = 0, the type of
--       factorisations through `classOf` is CONTRACTIBLE.  `isContr` is the
--       honest reading of the page's "there is a unique morphism".
--
--   §4  Uniqueness needs NO hypothesis on h at all, because `classOf` is
--       surjective (`[]surjective`) — the nLab's "the cokernel projection
--       is an epimorphism".  Existence is where the hypotheses are spent.
--
--   §5  The corpus's `descendedEvaluation` is THE map the universal
--       property produces, at A = Z/2.  It was already there; what was
--       missing is that it is the only one.  That is the whole difference
--       between "a quotient with a map out of it" and "a cokernel".
--
--   §6  CONTROLS, because everything above is parametric and a parametric
--       negative over an uninhabited parameter is green and empty.  The
--       bouquet (one vertex, one self-loop) instantiates §1; `CycleEvaluation`
--       is exhibited inhabited there; and H¹ of it is shown NOT to be a
--       singleton by a WITNESSED non-identity, twice, by two independent
--       routes (through exactness, and through the corpus's own pairing).
--       Without that, §2b would be consistent with H¹ always trivial, in
--       which case every theorem here is true and worthless.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  No group structure is put on the hand-rolled H¹
-- here, so this is the universal property in the category of SETS under
-- C¹, instantiated at abelian-group targets — not a proof that H¹ is the
-- cokernel in Ab.  Nothing computes H¹ for any graph beyond separating two
-- classes in the bouquet.  Nothing about H⁰, β₁, spanning trees, or any
-- degree above 1.  No iso is proved between this H¹ and cf-tessera-s-0's.
--
-- HOW THIS COULD BE TRUE AND IRRELEVANT.  If no downstream consumer ever
-- needs a SECOND map out of H¹, uniqueness is decoration: the corpus can
-- keep using `descendedEvaluation` forever without knowing it is canonical.
-- What uniqueness actually buys is that any two constructions of a cycle
-- pairing which agree on cochains agree on classes — a coherence obligation
-- that currently gets discharged by there being only one construction.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.6.3, cubical library v0.5 (this container, not the pin in
-- BUILD.md).  --cubical --guardedness --safe --no-import-sorts, no
-- postulates, no holes, EXIT 0.

--   * H¹ is not given a group structure here, so "cokernel in Ab" is not
--     proved — only the universal property against Ab-valued maps.
--     cf-tessera-s-0's parallel construction has the group structure; the
--     two H¹'s are still not connected by a proved iso, and §1 says why
--     that connection is not one line: the relations differ in whether
--     they are prop-valued, so the proof there does not transport here.
--   * No H⁰, no β₁, no degree > 1, no graph other than the bouquet.

-- WHAT THE nLab GAVE, AND WHERE IT GAVE NOTHING.  It gave the UNIQUENESS
-- clause, which is the whole difference §5 turns on, and the Ab Example
-- that says the quotient is by the IMAGE (hence the truncation in §2b).
-- It gave nothing constructive: the page is 40 lines, has no proof, no
-- 1-categorical construction of coker in Ab, and nothing at all about
-- graphs.  Its `chain complex` and `snake lemma` pages are likewise
-- statement-only.  A page of the nLab is a NAME plus a UNIVERSAL PROPERTY;
-- everything below the statement still has to be built in the substrate,
-- and cubical v0.5 has no `Cubical.Algebra.ChainComplex` to build it in.
