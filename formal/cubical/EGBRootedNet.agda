-- §2  The jewels: centre/radius points of the prime-pair net (§19)

-- A jewel is a centre w and a radius r.  Its legs are the two numbers
-- the centre is equidistant from; over ℕ they are written additively so
-- that no truncated subtraction enters the primary statements, which is
-- the discipline `EGBPairConic` §1 already fixed for this conic.

-- §5  What is NOT here, named so the gap is legible
--
-- * `Prime` does not occur.  A jewel here is a centre/radius point, not
--   a prime-pair WITNESS; §19's ξ = (w,r,p,q,π_p,π_q) carries the two
--   primality proofs and this type does not.  Adding them changes
--   nothing above and everything about what the Net means.
--
-- * `Thread` has no composition and no identity, so this is not yet a
--   category and Yoneda (T25.A: Map(x,y) ≃ Nat(y x, y y)) cannot be
--   stated, let alone proved.  Shared centre and shared radius are both
--   equivalence relations, so the composition exists; it is not written.
--
-- * Nothing here reweaves.  D0025 §16 and T25.F require that adjoining
--   an equivalence change every rooted profile functorially; that is the
--   operation whose absence D0025 §27 identifies as the whole failure,
--   and it is the next thing, not this thing.
