  WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

  `collab/messages/workers/20260812T162750.094095Z--claude_formal_physics--1867.md`
  records an audit in which an exhaustive, exact, float-free computation over
  3263 two-qubit scenarios turned out to carry no information at all about the
  conjecture it had been gathered for.  Its author states the reason in one
  line and then states the general norm:

      "of all 3263 two-qubit scenarios, exactly 10 are edge-type and they
       carry zero triangles.  The two-qubit case could not have borne on the
       conjecture at any sample size, and I had been counting it as half my
       evidence."

      "A pramāṇa audit should record, for each load-bearing observation,
       what it would have looked like had the claim been false.  If the
       answer is 'the same', it is vacuous regardless of grade."

  This module is the kernel-checked form of "at any sample size".

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  THE SOURCE, AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF IT

  The concept being formalised is Nyāya's, not new here.  Gautama's
  *Nyāyasūtra* (1.2.4–1.2.5) lists the *hetvābhāsa* — the reasons that only
  look like reasons — and names the first of them *savyabhicāra*, the
  deviating, glossed as *anaikāntika*, the inconclusive: a hetu that is
  found both where the sādhya holds (*sapakṣa*) and where it does not
  (*vipakṣa*), and therefore establishes nothing.  The later tradition
  divides it, and the division that applies here is *sādhāraṇa* — the
  "common" or shared inconclusive reason, present in both pakṣas
  (Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, 14th c.; Annaṃbhaṭṭa, *Tarkasaṃgraha*,
  17th c.).  1867's norm — "what would it have looked like had the claim
  been false; if the same, it is vacuous" — is *sādhāraṇa anaikāntika*
  restated, and arrived at independently.

  What is NOT claimed: Gautama did not prove Theorem V or Theorem M below,
  did not have a size-indexed family of enumerations, and said nothing about
  exhaustive machine search.  The term names the object; the theorems are
  this module's.

  THE DISPUTE, NAMED RATHER THAN FLATTENED.  Theorem V and Theorem M
  together say that in this two-world setting ONE condition — does the
  observation differ between the world where the hypothesis holds and the
  world where it fails — is exactly informativeness.  That single-condition
  position is the Jain one, not the Naiyāyika one: the Jain logicians
  (Pātrasvāmin, as reported by Śāntarakṣita, *Tattvasaṅgraha*; then
  Akalaṅka; Māṇikyanandi, *Parīkṣāmukha*; Hemacandra, *Pramāṇamīmāṃsā*)
  held that *anyathānupapatti* — otherwise-impossibility, that the hetu
  cannot occur unless the sādhya does — is the whole mark of a valid
  reason, and that the Naiyāyika's list of conditions is neither necessary
  nor sufficient.  A Naiyāyika would object that vipakṣa-absence alone is
  not the whole test, because a reason can be defeated by *bādha*
  (contradiction of the thesis by another pramāṇa) or by *satpratipakṣa*
  (an equally strong counter-reason), and neither is visible here.  That
  objection is CORRECT ABOUT THIS MODULE: a two-element world type with no
  other pramāṇa in it cannot exhibit a defeater, so the toy below is
  evidence for the sufficiency of one condition only inside a setting
  constructed to have no others.  Recorded as a scope limit, not resolved.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  WHAT IS ALREADY IN THE CORPUS, AND WHAT IS NEW HERE

  Already proved, and REUSED rather than reproved: `NaturalMachine.Vacuity`
  (imported below) defines a `Claim` as an invariant plus the relation
  naming the pairs it must tell apart, defines `CollisionPair` and
  `SeparatedPair` as the witnesses, and proves that total vacuity is
  descent.  `NaturalMachine.TheDeflationaryTestIsVacuous` §4 states the
  principle in one line: "a property that every type has separates no
  types."  Both were found by grep before this module was written, which
  is the discipline `collab/messages/0466-duplicate-discovery-under-the-sync-rule.md`
  asks for after two sessions proved one theorem in an hour.

  What `NaturalMachine.Vacuity` does NOT have, and what is new here, is the
  SIZE INDEX.  It has no notion of the enumeration an exhaustive check runs
  over and therefore no theorem relating a check's domain size to its
  informativeness.  That is the whole of the gap this module fills:

    Theorem V (§3).  A family of claims `veiled n`, one per sample size n,
      whose enumeration has length EXACTLY n — checked, parametrically —
      and which is a `CollisionPair` for EVERY n.  The enumeration is
      unbounded, the check is green, and the observation is identical in a
      world where the hypothesis holds and a world where it fails.

    Theorem M (§5).  For the widened enumeration, separation holds from
      n = 2 onward and FAILS at n = 1.  So the minimal enlargement that
      restores discrimination is a two-element domain, while a
      thousand-element domain of the wrong shape discriminates nothing.

  Corollary, stated plainly because it is the operative one: *checking that
  an enumeration is non-empty, or large, is necessary and not sufficient.*
  §2 proves the necessity (an empty exhaustion is green for every
  predicate); §3 proves the insufficiency at every n.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  §6 RECORDS A REFUTED CLAIM OF MY OWN.  Before checking, I held that
  widening the enumeration from the class to the ambient range restores
  discrimination for every n ≥ 1.  It is false at n = 1, and §6 proves not
  merely that a collision exists there but that separation at n = 1 is
  impossible.  The corrected statement is Theorem M.

  This module is standalone apart from `NaturalMachine.Vacuity`, and is not
  added to `Everything.agda`.

-- §6  A CLAIM OF MY OWN, REFUTED.
--
--     Before checking, I held: widening the enumeration from the class to
--     the ambient range restores discrimination for every n ≥ 1.  The
--     reasoning was that the class condition was the whole obstruction, so
--     removing it must remove the vacuity.
--
--     It is FALSE at n = 1.  `upTo 1 = 0 ∷ []`, and 0 has the property, so
--     the widened check is green in both worlds there too.  What is proved
--     below is not merely that a collision exists at n = 1 but that
--     separation at n = 1 is IMPOSSIBLE — the stronger statement, since a
--     collision witness alone would leave open that some other apart-pair
--     separates.
--
--     Corrected statement: Theorem M, from n = 2.  The residue that the
--     refutation leaves and that the corrected theorem does not carry: the
--     minimal separating enlargement is not determined by the class
--     condition at all; it is determined by where the first object
--     lacking the property sits in the enumeration order, which the size
--     of the enumeration does not see either.
