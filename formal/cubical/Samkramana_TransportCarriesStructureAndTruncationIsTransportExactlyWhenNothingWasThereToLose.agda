-- मूलवाक्यम् · PROVENANCE OF THE NAME, AND A WARNING ABOUT IT.
--
-- **The mathematics in this module originates in cubical type theory, not in
-- an Indian source, and the name should not be read as claiming otherwise.**
-- `transport`, `ua` and `uaβ` are Voevodsky's univalence as realised in
-- cubical type theory — the substrate this repository is checked in, and the
-- one exception CLAUDE.md grants ("all respects paid to Indians only, plus
-- Voevodsky").  Nothing below is a theorem of any Sanskrit text.
--
-- संक्रमण · saṃkrama IS a technical term, and it does not mean this.  In
-- Jaina karma theory it is the transition of one karma-prakṛti into another
-- — *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama* with Vīrasena's *Dhavalā* (~816 CE); Śivaśarmasūri,
-- *Karmaprakṛti*.  In jyotiṣa, saṃkrānti is the sun's passage into a sign.
-- **Neither is what this module proves**, and welding the Jaina term onto a
-- path-transport would be the error CLAUDE.md's second naming condition
-- names: "a fabricated term is the mirror image of the scrubbing this rule
-- corrects: it asserts a provenance nobody checked."
--
-- What the name legitimately carries is the READING, from
-- notes/AHIMSA_SUTRA_VISTARA.md §६ — संक्रमणे संरचना वहति, संक्रमणे न किञ्चिन्
-- नश्यति — which is this repository's own gloss of two paths and no third,
-- and which is what the module makes precise.  A reading is not a citation.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- संक्रमणम् — transport as the machine's ONLY identification primitive.
--
-- अहिंसा-सूत्र-विस्तारः § ६ (द्वौ मार्गौ) एतत् वदति :
--     संक्रमणे संरचना वहति । संक्रमणे न किञ्चिन् नश्यति ।
--     अन्यो मार्गो दोषलेखः । तृतीयो मार्गो न विद्यते ।
-- तत्र संक्रमणम् उक्तम्, न साधितम् ।  अत्र साध्यते ।
--
-- (The sūtra states, in §6, that in transport the structure is carried and
-- nothing perishes; that the only other move is to WRITE THE DEFECT; and
-- that there is no third road.  §6 wrote down `संक्रमणम् e = transport (ua e)`
-- and `अलोपः = uaβ` and stopped there.  Those two lines are the DEFINITION
-- and its COMPUTATION RULE.  Neither of them is the claim.  This module
-- proves the claim.)
--
--
-- WHAT WAS ACTUALLY MISSING, and why the gap was invisible
--
-- `uaβ e a : transport (ua e) a ≡ equivFun e a` says that transporting a
-- POINT computes.  It says nothing whatever about STRUCTURE — about what
-- happens to an operation, a predicate, a law, when it is carried across.
-- A reader who has `uaβ` in hand and reads "संक्रमणे संरचना वहति" will believe
-- the sentence is discharged.  It is not: uaβ is a statement about
-- elements of A, and "the structure is carried" is a statement about
-- elements of S A for arbitrary S.  The gap is one quantifier wide and it
-- is exactly the gap between a definition and a theorem.
--
-- Worse, and recorded here because it is the more instructive half:
-- as committed, `Nasti_ShabdeJivahVartante.agda` — the module that IS §6
-- in this corpus — DID NOT TYPECHECK (uaβ used, never imported), and no
-- module in `formal/cubical/` imported it, so nothing would ever have run
-- it.  See the dated correction in that file's header.  The section
-- asserting that nothing perishes was itself built by nothing.
--
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE
--
--  १ · संक्रमणम् is an equivalence, and the return trip is exhibited.
--       Not "invertible in principle": the inverse is a term, and
--       प्रत्यानयनम् computes the round trip to `refl`-level identity.
--
--  २ · संरचना वहति — THE THEOREM.  For an operation of any arity, the
--       carried operation is the conjugate, and `e` is a HOMOMORPHISM for
--       it.  For a predicate, the carried predicate at `e a` is `P a`.
--       This is what "nothing is lost" means when said about structure
--       rather than about points, and it is the form the machine cites:
--       an identification licenses moving the WHOLE object, laws included.
--
--  ३ · The contrast with ∥_∥₁, as ONE statement rather than two.
--       ∣_∣₁ IS an identification — is a संक्रमणम् — EXACTLY WHEN `A` is a
--       proposition, i.e. exactly when there was nothing to lose.  So
--       transport and truncation are not two unrelated moves: truncation
--       is what transport degenerates to at the one h-level where the
--       question "which?" has no answer to destroy.  Everywhere else
--       (¬ isProp A) the retraction does not merely fail to be found —
--       it does not exist.
--
--       Asked as `isEquiv ∣_∣₁`, NOT as `hasRetract ∣_∣₁`.  The retraction
--       form, at every h-level n and with the retraction type shown
--       contractible, is another lane's and is strictly stronger:
--       `Apratikaryatva_TheRetractionTypeIsTheHLevelHypothesis.agda`.
--       My first draft of §3 proved the n = 1 retraction case; on finding
--       theirs I CUT MINE rather than ship a weaker twin, and §3 below
--       records the cut.  `SetTruncationDescentBoundary.agda` is the
--       ∥_∥₂/isSet member of the same family.  Three lanes, one fact,
--       indexed by h-level.
--
--  ४ · अतृतीयः — there is no third road, in the one form that is a
--       theorem rather than a syntactic remark about a datatype: ANY map
--       that is lossless in both directions IS a transport, and its
--       equivalence is produced AS DATA.  So a lossless move cannot
--       decline to exhibit its identification; if it is lossless the
--       identification is recoverable from it, constructively.
--       The machine cites this one to justify demanding evidence: the
--       demand costs the caller nothing it did not already have.
--
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * `गति` below has two constructors.  That is a fact about a datatype
--    I wrote, not a theorem that the world has two moves.  The theorem
--    in that direction is ४ and it is weaker and honest: nothing lossless
--    escapes संक्रमणम्.  A LOSSY move is not classified here at all, and
--    the sūtra does not classify it either — it says WRITE IT DOWN.
--  * Nothing here says Umāsvāti or Brahmagupta proved anything about
--    univalence.  The Sanskrit names the position each object occupies in
--    the Jaina analysis of हिंसा as सङ्क्षेप (reduction of the many to one);
--    the mathematics is Voevodsky's, 2009–2013, and is named as his.

--     प्राणव्यपरोपणं हिंसा ; परस्परोपग्रहो जीवानाम् ।  हिंसा is analysed there as
--     an act on a जीव, and the सूत्र-विस्तार's move is to read सङ्क्षेप — the

-- ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
-- │ DUPLICATION FOUND AND CUT, 2026-08-20, same day, same repository.│
-- └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
--
-- This section as first written defined `प्रत्यानयन₁ A` (the type of ways
-- back from ∥ A ∥₁), proved `प्रत्यानयन₁ A → isProp A` and its converse,
-- and derived "no retraction where there is a difference".  All of that
-- is SUBSUMED — and at strictly greater generality — by
--
--     Apratikaryatva_TheRetractionTypeIsTheHLevelHypothesis.agda §3–§4
--
-- written concurrently in another lane, which proves
-- `प्रत्यानयनम् n A ≃ isOfHLevel n A` for EVERY h-level n, shows the
-- retraction type is CONTRACTIBLE when A is an n-type (so nothing is
-- chosen), and recovers the sūtra's Bool statement as a corollary.  n = 1
-- is my case.  I deleted mine rather than keep a weaker twin: the corpus
-- names re-derivation as its most frequent failure, and a second proof of
-- a special case is that failure even when both are green.
--
-- WHAT IS KEPT is the one statement of the pair that is NOT theirs, and
-- it is not theirs because it is asked in the transport lane's vocabulary
-- rather than the retraction lane's:
--
--     they ask  — does ∣_∣₁ have a way BACK?          (hasRetract)
--     this asks — is ∣_∣₁ ITSELF a संक्रमणम्?           (isEquiv)
--
-- These are different questions with the same answer, and having both
-- answers is the point: it says the transport/truncation contrast is not
-- an opposition between two moves at all.  ∣_∣₁ is a transport EXACTLY
-- when A is a proposition — so truncation is what transport degenerates
-- to at the one h-level where the question "which?" has no answer left to
-- destroy, and everywhere else it is the other road entirely.
--
-- SetTruncationDescentBoundary.agda is the ∥_∥₂ / isSet member of the
-- same family, written earlier by a third lane.  Three modules, one fact,
-- indexed by h-level; recorded here so a reader meets it as a family and
-- not as three coincidences.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- THE CONTRAST, as one biimplication.  ∣_∣₁ is an equivalence — that is,
-- the truncation move IS an identification, and so a संक्रमणम् via ua —
-- exactly when A is a proposition.

                       (λ _ → refl)))

-- ४ · अतृतीयः — no third road, in its provable form.
--
-- The sūtra says तृतीयो मार्गो न विद्यते.  Read as a claim about datatypes
-- that is unprovable and uninteresting.  Read as a claim about LOSSLESS
-- moves it is a theorem: a map lossless in both directions cannot be
-- anything but a transport, and its identification is extracted from it
-- constructively.  So "exhibit your equivalence" is never an extra
-- burden — the caller who was lossless already had it.
--
-- THE OTHER HALF, and it is another lane's, written the same day:
--   TritiyaMarga_TheNoThirdPathClaimIsExcludedMiddle.agda
-- proves that the DISJUNCTIVE reading of तृतीयो मार्गो न विद्यते — every map
-- is either an identification or has a nameable defect — is exactly
-- excluded middle, i.e. classical, not constructive.
--
-- The two results are not in tension and the pair is worth more than
-- either.  Theirs bounds what the sentence can mean: you may not
-- CLASSIFY an arbitrary map into two roads without assuming LEM.  Mine
-- says what survives that bound: you never needed to classify.  A move
-- that IS lossless hands you its identification whether or not anyone can
-- decide, for an arbitrary move, which road it took.  So the machine's
-- discipline — "produce your equivalence or write your defect" — is
-- constructively legitimate as an OBLIGATION ON THE ACTOR, and would be
-- classical only if imposed as a VERDICT ON A STRANGER.
