--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE SOURCE, AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED OF IT
--
-- **paryāpti-sambandha** — the relation of complete occurrence — is
-- Navya-Nyāya's answer to a question about WHERE a property resides.
-- Number beyond unity (saṃkhyā: dvitva, tritva) does not reside in each
-- member of a collection distributively; "this pot is two" is false of
-- every pot.  It resides in the collection TAKEN AS A WHOLE, and the
-- relation by which it does so is paryāpti.  The apparatus naming the
-- slots — pratiyogin (counterpositive: WHAT is absent), anuyogin
-- (locus), avacchedaka (delimitor: under which qualification) — is
-- Gaṅgeśa, *Tattvacintāmaṇi*, c. 1325.  The paryāpti treatment of
-- number is developed by Raghunātha Śiromaṇi, *Padārthatattvanirūpaṇa*,
-- c. 1500, and by Gadādhara after him.
--
-- **NOT CLAIMED:** that any of them stated, proved, or anticipated the
-- theorem below.  What IS claimed is narrower, and is the reason for the
-- name: the theorem below turns on the difference between a property
-- predicated of the carrier distributively and the same property
-- predicated of the collection.  That distinction is theirs, under that
-- name, seven centuries earlier.  Their example is number; the example
-- here is a rejection witness.
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT WAS FOUND ALREADY DONE, AND IS NOT REDONE HERE
--
-- Grepped `notes/`, `collab/messages/`, `formal/` for the source text's
-- OWN name (`Tattvacintāmaṇi`, not just `Gaṅgeśa`) BEFORE writing:
--
--   `formal/cubical/NaturalMachine/Abhava.agda`, `notes/NO_BARE_ABSENCES.md`
--       — abhāva with pratiyogin; the absence tower; `dec-collapses`.
--   `formal/cubical/AbhavaAvacchedaka.agda`
--       — the avacchedaka as a genuine dependent binder, load-bearing.
--   `notes/EVERY_OBSTRUCTION_HERE_IS_EXACT.md`
--       — **withdraws** Abhava's reading: `¬-always-stable` needs no
--         hypothesis, so the absence tower is two-tall for every `A`,
--         and decidability lands on the PRATIYOGIN, not on the absence.
--   `NaturalMachine.WhereTheTowerCanStillBeThree` §5
--       — hence the live question is Σ-SHAPED pratiyogins: "a decidable
--         Σ is stable, so the floor's stability is exactly a SEARCH
--         question."
--   `NaturalMachine.CountingIsWhatDecidableEqualityBuys…`
--       — proves `Perm xs ys → count a xs ≡ count a ys`, and states that
--         the converse "must BUILD a permutation … and that search is
--         where finiteness and decidability do real work."
--
-- **None of the above is re-derived.**  `Perm` does not appear here; the
-- relation below is `_⊑_` (sub-multiset), which is not that module's
-- object, and no theorem of any of those files is used, altered, or
-- restated.  This file answers the question they leave open, on ONE
-- object: for a Σ-shaped pratiyogin, WHAT BOUNDS THE SEARCH?
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE OBJECT (frontier: combinatorics of sub-multiset matching with
-- residue — why the residue is sound)
--
-- `xs ⊑ ys` — every element of the multiset `xs` is matched to a
-- DISTINCT occurrence in `ys`.  A *residue test* rejects candidates
-- cheaply: map both sides into a commutative monoid by a homomorphism
-- and compare.  The received account of why such a test is sound is a
-- collision estimate (fingerprinting: a hash can only cause a false
-- ACCEPT, and here is the bound).
--
-- **§1 says the estimate is buying nothing.**  Soundness is the
-- homomorphism property and only that: `⊑-sound` takes NO decidable
-- equality, NO finiteness of the carrier, NO injectivity of the residue,
-- and NO order on the monoid — the order it produces is the ALGEBRAIC
-- one and it hands back the QUOTIENT as an explicit witness.  Every
-- estimate in that literature is buying COMPLETENESS.
--
-- **§1b prices that, and the price is sharp.**  If the residue monoid is
-- a GROUP, the quotient always exists, so `residue-rejects` is VACUOUS —
-- a group-valued residue can never reject a containment, only an
-- equality of residues.  So the received "the fingerprint rejects, hence
-- no match" is, for every group-valued fingerprint, a rejection of a
-- DIFFERENT absence: its pratiyogin is a residue class, not an element.
-- Soundness's whole content is therefore *which* monoid, and this is
-- checked, not asserted.
--
-- **§2–§4 say where the cost actually sits.**  The counterpositive of a
-- rejection — `Σ[ a ∈ A ] count a ys < count a xs` — is Σ-shaped and
-- ranges over the whole carrier `A`, which may be infinite and is not
-- assumed searchable.  `paryāpti` proves that Σ has the same inhabitants
-- as the one delimited to membership in `xs`.  The unbounded existential
-- over the carrier collapses to a bounded one over the collection; only
-- then is it decidable, and only then is Markov's principle for it
-- DISCHARGED rather than assumed (§4).
--
-- One sentence: **soundness of the residue costs nothing; extracting a
-- witness from its failure costs exactly the delimitor.**
--
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
--
--  * NO COMPLETENESS.  Nothing here proves residue-domination implies
--    `⊑`.  That is the converse and it is not attempted.
--  * NO UNDECIDABILITY.  §3 shows the delimited Σ IS decidable given
--    `Discrete A`.  It does NOT show the undelimited Σ is undecidable
--    without it — that needs a countermodel and none is built.  What is
--    exhibited is that `Discrete A` appears in §2–§4 and is absent from
--    §1: a statement about these proofs, not a lower bound.
--  * NO CLAIM ABOUT AGGREGATE RESIDUES.  §1 covers every monoid
--    homomorphism, a single sum-hash included.  §2–§4 concern the
--    PER-ELEMENT counting residue.  Whether a rejection by an aggregate
--    residue yields an element witness is not settled here — and for
--    `Discrete A` it trivially does, by ignoring the aggregate and
--    running §3, which is itself the point: the aggregate contributes
--    cost, not level.
--  * `_⊑_` is one presentation of sub-multiset containment.  Its
--    agreement with any other presentation in this corpus is not proved.
--
-- CHECKED on the CONTAINER: Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 at
-- /root/agda-libs/cubical; `agda` with no CLI flags, `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`.
-- NOT the repository's declared pin (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical v0.9); see
-- `notes/MY_GREENS_THIS_SESSION_ARE_CONTAINER_GREENS.md`.
-- --safe, no postulates, no holes.

  -- 1b.  AND HERE IS WHAT SOUNDNESS COSTS WHEN THE TARGET IS A GROUP:

  --
  --      It can still reject EQUALITY of the two residues.  But that is
  --      a DIFFERENT ABSENCE with a different pratiyogin: a residue
  --      class, not an element of `A`.  Reading a group-valued
