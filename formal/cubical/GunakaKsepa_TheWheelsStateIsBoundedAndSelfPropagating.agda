-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- गुणक-क्षेपौ — the wheel's state is bounded, and it carries its own next
-- class.  (Guṇaka = the multiplier m; kṣepa = the interpolator k.  Both
-- are Bhāskara's own words for these two quantities in the
-- वर्गप्रकृति chapter of the बीजगणितम्, 1150 CE; the cycle itself is
-- JAYADEVA's, ~950, surviving through Udayadivākara's सुन्दरी, 1073.
-- Nothing below claims either of them stated any theorem in this file.
-- What is claimed is that these are the two quantities their algorithm
-- carries from turn to turn, and this file is about that pair.)
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  `notes/DosaLekha_TheCakravalaTurnCapIsNotABound.md`
-- §5 names, verbatim, the piece that is missing:
--
--     "A checked bound on the turn count.  The `2·D` default rests on
--      reduction theory that is not in `formal/cubical/`.  Putting it there
--      — the finiteness of reduced forms of a given discriminant — is the
--      piece that would turn the default from *cited* into *checked*."
--
-- This file puts a version of it there.  It does not close termination.
-- It closes something else, which is what a turn cap actually needs and
-- which is strictly weaker than termination:
--
--     IF the wheel reaches क्षेप = 1 AT ALL, it does so within B² turns,
--     where B is the least natural with 4D < B².
--
-- That implication needs only (i) the state (गुणक, क्षेप) lying in a box of
-- side B, and (ii) the next state being a function of the current one.
-- It does NOT need the wheel to reach 1.  §1–§4 prove (i) outright.  §5
-- proves the algebraic core of (ii) and §6 says exactly what of (ii) is
-- still missing, with the failing shape named rather than gestured at.
--
-- AND ONE CORRECTION TO THE CITATION THAT `2·D` RESTS ON, §7.  The
-- justification recorded for `turnCap d = 2·d` is "the pairs (P, Q) with
-- 0 < P < √D and 0 < Q < 2√D".  The cakravāla's own multiplier does NOT
-- satisfy P < √D: for D = 1989 the wheel's first turn takes m = 62 and
-- √1989 < 45.  So that count is a count of something else — reduced surds
-- of the continued fraction — and the claim that the cakravāla is a
-- "sub-walk" of it is a third unchecked input, not a restatement of the
-- first two.  The bound proved here, m² ≤ 4D, is the one the algorithm's
-- own state actually satisfies.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED.  --safe, no postulates, no holes, Agda 2.8.0 +
-- cubical v0.9 (the pin).
--
--   गुणक-बन्धः        THE MULTIPLIER IS IN THE SAME WINDOW AS THE
--                    INTERPOLATOR: m² ≤ 4D, from `CakravalaBound`'s own
--                    conclusion 16E² ≤ 36·D·K² together with K² ≤ 4D.
--                    `CakravalaBound` bounds K and never bounds m; without
--                    an m-bound the state is not in a box and none of the
--                    counting below can start.
--   कोष्ठकः           x² ≤ c < B² gives x < B.  The box, as an inequality
--                    between naturals with no square root anywhere.
--   अङ्कनम् / अङ्कन-एकत्वम्
--                    the state (m, K) coded as m·B + K, and that code is
--                    INJECTIVE on the box — so a repeated code is a
--                    repeated state and not merely a collision.
--   अवस्था-पुनरावृत्तिः  THE COUNT.  Any B²+1 turns whose states lie in the
--                    box contain two DISTINCT turns with the SAME state.
--                    Cubical's `pigeonhole`; the finiteness is the content.
--   प्रत्यावृत्तिः      THE WHEEL CARRIES ITS OWN NEXT CLASS.  Over ℤ, from
--                    the three exact divisions of the cakravāla step,
--                        a' + b'·(−m)  ≡  k'·(−b),
--                    i.e. −m ALREADY SOLVES the next turn's congruence
--                    k' | (a' + b'·m'), with cofactor −b.  So the next
--                    multiplier's residue class is −m mod k', which is a
--                    function of the current state alone.  This is the
--                    algebraic core of determinism, and it is three ring
--                    identities.
--   षष्ट्येक-प्रत्यावृत्तिः  D = 61, turn 0 → turn 1, computed in the kernel.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT PROVED, so nobody has to guess.
--
--   * TERMINATION IS STILL OPEN and this file does not narrow it.  What is
--     established is a CONDITIONAL cap: exceeding B² turns proves a state
--     repeated, and — given §6's missing lemma — that the wheel is in a
--     cycle that will never reach क्षेप = 1.  A cap is a resource limit
--     whose failure now carries a mathematical claim instead of a shrug.
--   * DETERMINISM IS NOT COMPLETE.  §5 gives that −m solves the next
--     congruence.  Two things remain: (a) that the solution set IS the
--     class of −m, which needs gcd(b', k') = 1 — the same coprimality
--     `CakravalaDescent.oneCongruenceCoprime` already consumes, and which
--     is produced by a kuṭṭaka run, not assumed; and (b) TIES.  Bhāskara's
--     rule minimises |m² − D| over the class, and by
--     `Varana_TheChoiceWindowIsDerivedNotFitted` the minimiser is one of
--     the two bracketing members lo, hi — but if E_lo ≡ E_hi the rule does
--     not name which, and the next गुणक is then not a function of the
--     state.  A tie is a genuine branch, not an oversight, and it is what
--     stands between §5 and a determinism theorem.
--   * `CakravalaBound.agda`'s hypotheses are taken here as hypotheses.
--     §1's input `16·E² ≤ 36·(D·K²)` is that file's `straddleBound`
--     conclusion; this file does not import it, because under the pin
--     that module does not typecheck — its `Cubical.Tactics.NatSolver`
--     import uses the v0.5 name `solve` where v0.9 has `solveℕ!`.  That
--     is a live defect in a module this one depends on for its input, it
--     is recorded in `notes/`, and it is NOT repaired here because
--     another lane's working tree is mid-repair across the whole
--     directory.  `Varana_TheChoiceWindowIsDerivedNotFitted` declines the
--     same import for the same reason and restates its lemmas; this file
--     follows that precedent.
--   * §5 is over ℤ, and the reactor divides by |k| and then takes
--     absolute values of both new coordinates.  That sign normalisation
--     is not proved to preserve the congruence.  It was CHECKED to
--     preserve it over 38 700 turns for every non-square D ≤ 3000, which
--     is a finite exhaustive verification of a finite range and is
--     nothing else.

-- `machine/Nalanda.hs`'s turn cap is justified by "the pairs (P, Q) with
-- 0 < P < √D and 0 < Q < 2√D".  The cakravāla's own multiplier does not
-- obey the first: for D = 1989 the reactor's turn 0 is (44, 1, −53) and
-- the rule selects m = 62, with 62² = 3844 and D = 1989 — so m² is nearly
-- TWICE D, and m is half again as large as √D.  Below, in ℕ, which is
-- GMP-backed and so computes:
--
--   * 1989 < 62², the refutation of "P < √D" for this algorithm's state;
--   * §1 applied at that turn, giving 62² ≤ 4·1989 — the bound the state
--     DOES obey, and the above-the-root branch of §1, which is the branch
--     with content;
--   * §2 at B = 90 = ⌊√(4·1989)⌋ + 1, putting the turn in the box.

-- One turn of one D refutes a universal and is worth exactly that; it

-- finite exhaustive check of a finite range: over every non-square
-- D ≤ 5000, 35 060 of the reactor's turns have m² > D.  That number is a
