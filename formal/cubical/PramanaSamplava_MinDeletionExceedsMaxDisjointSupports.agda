-- PramanaSamplava_MinDeletionExceedsMaxDisjointSupports
--
-- ONE derivation hypergraph, six rules, five facts, one seed, in which
--
--     min |D| such that v dies      =  2
--     max pairwise-disjoint supports =  1
--     the fractional optimum         =  3/2
--
-- so the deletion min-max FAILS, and it fails at the smallest place a
-- conjunctive premise can be put.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.  `notes/REVISION_DERIVATION_HYPERGRAPH.md` proves
-- the exact deletion law for a finite AND/OR derivation hypergraph:
--
--     v ∈ Cl_D(I)   ⟺   some minimal support S of v has S ∩ D = ∅,
--
-- i.e. v dies exactly when the deleted set D is a HITTING SET of the
-- minimal-support antichain A(v).  That note computes A(v) and says
-- nothing about the size of the cheapest killing D.  This module decides
-- that question on one instance, in the direction that costs something.
--
-- NAME.  Nyāya holds *pramāṇa-samplava*: one and the same object may be
-- established by more than one pramāṇa — the stock illustration being
-- fire on a hill, reached by perception, by inference and by testimony
-- (Vātsyāyana, *Nyāyabhāṣya*, c. 400 CE, on the Nyāyasūtra's opening
-- enumeration of the pramāṇas).  Dignāga holds the opposite,
-- *pramāṇa-vyavasthā*: exactly two pramāṇas, each with its OWN object,
-- svalakṣaṇa for perception and sāmānyalakṣaṇa for inference, so a single
-- object is not multiply established (*Pramāṇasamuccaya* I.2, c. 480–540
-- CE).  The object formalised below — one fact carrying several
-- independent supports, and the question of what survives when supports
-- are removed — is samplava's object, and the module is named for it.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED ABOUT THE SOURCES.  Not claimed: that any
-- Naiyāyika or Buddhist logician proved anything below, or that the two
-- schools' dispute is settled by a Boolean computation.  Claimed only:
-- the standing dispute is over whether one object has several
-- independent establishments, that is the configuration this module
-- computes with, and the Nyāya term is therefore the term for the object
-- rather than a decoration.  The two schools reject each other's frame
-- (Dignāga's restriction is not a special case of samplava, it denies
-- it), so this module takes the samplava side ONLY as a naming of the
-- configuration under study, and asserts nothing about the other.  Both
-- citations are from memory; the texts are not in this container and
-- were not consulted.
--
-- PRIOR ART, searched before writing (per CLAUDE.md), all on disk:
--   * `notes/HISTORY_DIGEST.md` attributes the deletion law itself to de
--     Kleer's ATMS label semantics (1986), "essentially verbatim".  The
--     law is NOT claimed new here; it is used, and independently
--     re-verified on this instance (`deletion-law`).
--   * `notes/PROOF_SUPPORT_COMPLEMENTARITY.md` proves the retention-side
--     observable q_v is submodular iff every minimal support is a
--     singleton.  DIFFERENT statement, and §5 of the companion message
--     shows the two failures are independent: on the unary fragment
--     q_v is already non-submodular while the deletion min-max is still
--     integral.
--   * `notes/OBLIGATION_S7_MINCUT.md` + `formal/cubical/ObligationMinCut.agda`
--     compute an audit burden as an exact max-flow/min-cut in a
--     DIGRAPH.  That is the unary fragment, where the min-max holds.
--     The repair note for it is in the companion message, not here, and
--     that file is not edited.
--
-- TOOLCHAIN.  Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5 at /root/agda-libs/cubical,
-- invoked as `agda <file>` with no CLI flags, LC_ALL=C.UTF-8.  Exit code
-- reported in the companion message.  No postulates, no holes, --safe.
--
-- METHOD.  Everything below is closed Boolean/ℕ computation over the 64
-- deletion sets, discharged by `refl`.  CLAUDE.md: "a finite exhaustive
-- verification … produces mathematical objects, not measurements."  No
-- floating point, no fitting, no sampling.
