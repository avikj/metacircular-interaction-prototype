-- Everything
--
-- THE WHOLE DIRECTORY, IN ONE COMMAND.
--
-- `NaturalMachine.agda` is the root of the NaturalMachine/ subtree and
-- BUILD.md's green claim is stated in terms of it.  That claim was
-- honest and it was also NARROWER THAN IT LOOKED: at the time this file
-- was written there were **33 further modules at the top level of
-- formal/cubical/** that the NaturalMachine root does not import.  Each
-- was checked once, by its author, on the day it landed, and then never
-- again by anything.
--
-- That is the same hole BUILD.md already describes one level down:
--
--     "an orphan that the root does not import is exactly the hole that
--      let the earlier overstatement hide."
--
-- The lesson had been learned for `NaturalMachine/*.agda` and not for
-- `*.agda`.  A green claim that covers 1 of 34 top-level modules is not
-- false, but a reader will take it for more than it says — which is the
-- failure mode this corpus keeps catching itself in, and the reason the
-- fix is a MODULE rather than a sentence in a markdown file.  A sentence
-- rots; an import list fails the build.
--
-- All 34 were verified exit 0 individually before this file was created,
-- so it is a latch on a state that already held, not a repair.
--
--
-- WHAT THIS COVERS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
--
--  * Every `.agda` file at the top level of `formal/cubical/`, plus the
--    `NaturalMachine` root (hence, transitively, all of
--    `NaturalMachine/`).
--
--  * `NaturalMachine/Control/` is EXCLUDED, permanently and on purpose.
--    Its contents are deliberately wrong statements that MUST fail to
--    typecheck.  Nothing may ever import it.  If a future edit makes
--    `Control/` check, that is the bug.
--
--  * The Lean lane (`formal/pairfield/`) is a different toolchain and is
--    not covered by anything here.
--
-- Everything is imported PLAIN, never `open`ed and never `public`.  The
-- modules were written independently and collide freely on short names
-- (`Q`, `τ`, `step`, `see`, `W`, `InvLim`, …); re-exporting them would
-- turn an aggregate into a merge conflict.  The point is that the kernel
-- checks them, not that a client can dot into them from here.
