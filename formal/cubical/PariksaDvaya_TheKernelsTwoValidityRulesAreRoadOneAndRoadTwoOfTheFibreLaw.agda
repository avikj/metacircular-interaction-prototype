-- परीक्षा-द्वयम् — the two examinations.  The metacircular kernel's two
-- validity rules (kernel/nodes/002, 003) are road one and road two of the
-- fibre law, and their orthogonality (kernel/nodes/006) is a theorem about
-- the universal decomposition A ≃ Σ[b] fiber f b — not prose in a markdown
-- node.
--
-- THE KERNEL, IN ITS OWN WORDS.  kernel/nodes/006-fork-discharged.md proves
-- the two candidate validity rules detect DISJOINT, EXHAUSTIVE error
-- classes, forced by node 001's content/gauge split:
--   002 — validity by decidable check: catches derivation-internal error,
--         and STRUCTURALLY CANNOT catch a frame error ("a gauge is not
--         outside the [technique] library — it is inside it, wearing the
--         right type").
--   003 — validity by conservation across re-derivation: catches the frame
--         error (the well-typed gauge that froze a variable).
-- Node 006's result: "the two detect disjoint, exhaustive error classes …
-- orthogonality, not subsumption."
--
-- THE FIBRE LAW.  SarvavibhagaH: for every f : A → B,
--   सर्वविभागः : A ≃ Σ[ b ∈ B ] fiber f b     (the universal decomposition,
-- the totalEquiv; Punaragamana.Carrier f is its total space).  The SOURCE
-- projection is an equivalence for EVERY f.  The TARGET side — whether each
-- fiber f b is contractible — is `isEquiv f`, and a non-equivalence loses
-- there.
--
-- THE IDENTIFICATION.  The two are the same partition:
--   ROAD ONE  = 002's reach.  A ≃ Σ[b] fiber f b holds for all f: the
--     derivation is well-formed no matter what.  Node 001's "a gauge is
--     well-typed" is exactly this — the decomposition always typechecks, so
--     road-one clearance says nothing about whether f lost anything.
--   ROAD TWO  = 003's invariant.  isEquiv f — every fiber contractible — is
--     whether the frame carried hidden loss.  It is INDEPENDENT of road one.
--
-- So node 006's orthogonality IS: road one holds for every f, road two does
-- not, and a map can be road-one-clear while road-two-failing.  That map is
-- the frame error 002 cannot see — a non-equivalence whose source
-- decomposition still holds.  The frozen ε (001's forcing instance, a
-- well-typed statement that dropped a variable) has this exact shape.
--
-- WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED.  This formalises the DETECTION-CLASS
-- orthogonality of 006 as a fibre-law theorem: road one is universal, road
-- two is not, they are independent.  It does not formalise the whole
-- metacircular apparatus (self-application, the re-derivation dynamics of
-- 003).  What it shows is that the load-bearing content of 006 — two
-- disjoint validity readings — is the fibre law's two sides, so the "two
-- validity rules" are not two axioms; they are one object read on its two
-- projections.  Aligns with NastoddistaPariksa and Tantujala (isEquiv f ≡
-- every fiber contractible) and Sesa (हस्ते/न-लक्ष्ये, the same collapsing
-- map Bool→Unit).
--
-- Checked warm through नाडी against the container's agda — छिद्रं नास्ति.
