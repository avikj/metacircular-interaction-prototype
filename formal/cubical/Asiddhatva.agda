-- Asiddhatva — Pāṇini 8.2.1 as a termination technique for rewriting
-- systems, with the impossibility half that makes it necessary.
--
-- THE SOURCE.  Aṣṭādhyāyī 8.2.1, `pūrvatrāsiddham`: everything from this
-- sūtra to the end of the text is asiddha — "as if not having taken
-- effect" — with respect to everything before it.  The last three quarter-
-- chapters (8.2, 8.3, 8.4, the tripādī) therefore produce output that the
-- preceding rules, and the earlier rules *within* the tripādī, cannot
-- observe.  Pāṇini, ~500 BCE; Kātyāyana's vārttikas ~250 BCE; Patañjali's
-- Mahābhāṣya ~150 BCE.
--
-- THE WITNESS IS NOT INVENTED.  It is what the engine in `machine/
-- Astadhyayi.hs` actually does when it derives `vāk` ("speech") from the
-- stem `vāc`, and its `asiddhaAudit` prints the refusal:
--
--     vāc  --8.2.30 coḥ kuḥ-->          vāk
--          --8.2.39 jhalāṃ jaśo 'nte--> vāg
--          --8.4.56 vāvasāne-->         vāk
--     8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham: 8.2.39 would fire on this output, refused
--
-- 8.2.39 sends k to g.  8.4.56 sends g back to k.  Let 8.2.39 see what
-- 8.4.56 produced and the derivation runs forever.  This module is that
-- two-rule cycle, and four theorems about it.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED HERE
--
--   noNormalForm      the unstratified system has NO normal form: every
--                     element of the carrier admits a step.  Exhaustive,
--                     three cases.
--   noNormalizer      hence no normalizing function exists at all — not a
--                     clever one, not any.
--   everyLength       and reductions of every finite length exist from
--                     every point.
--
--   noStrictOrder     THE SHARP ONE.  There is no strict order — merely
--                     irreflexive and transitive — in which every rule
--                     step decreases.  Not a reduction order; not even a
--                     strict partial order.  So EVERY termination
--                     technique that works by exhibiting such an order
--                     fails on this system: recursive path orders, the
--                     Knuth–Bendix order, polynomial interpretations,
--                     matrix interpretations, and Knuth–Bendix completion
--                     itself, which is parameterised by a reduction order
--                     and cannot orient a cycle.  The proof is four lines:
--                     k > g and g > k give k > k.
--
--   vākByRefl         the stratified evaluator computes vāc ↦ vāk on the
--                     nose, and is a total function, accepted by the
--                     termination checker.
--   asiddhaLoadBearing
--                     and its result is NOT a fixpoint of the earlier
--                     stratum — 8.2.39 would fire on it.  The refusal is
--                     what terminates the system.  Take asiddhatva away and
--                     `noNormalForm` is what you have left.
--
-- SO THE STATEMENT IS: this rewriting system is not order-terminating, and
-- Pāṇini terminates it anyway, by a constraint on which rules may OBSERVE
-- which outputs rather than by a measure that decreases.  He then shipped
-- that constraint across three quarter-chapters of a ~3983-rule production
-- system.
--
-- PRIOR ART, searched before writing, as this repository requires.  The
-- qualitative parallel is documented and is NOT claimed here as new:
-- asiddhatva has long been read as rule-suspension / level ordering —
-- Kiparsky, "On the Architecture of Pāṇini's Grammar" (Sanskrit
-- Computational Linguistics, LNCS 5402, 2009, and earlier circulated
-- versions), and a full monograph exists on the suspension principle
-- itself.  Stratified and hierarchical termination is also known in
-- rewriting theory (Bergstra–Klop on layered systems; Ohlebusch on
-- modularity of termination, 1990s) — so the technique is not unknown to
-- the field, it is *late* to it, and it is not what the field teaches as
-- the general method.  What I did not find stated anywhere, and what is
-- checked here, is the impossibility half: the exhibition of a rule pair
-- inside the tripādī for which no strict order exists at all.  If that is
-- stated somewhere I did not reach, this is a re-derivation and the
-- citation is owed.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.  Every theorem below is an exhaustive
-- finite case analysis or a `refl`.

-- 5.  THE IMPOSSIBILITY.  No strict order orients this system.
--
--     A reduction order — what every order-based termination method and
--     Knuth–Bendix completion require — is in particular irreflexive and
--     transitive.  Only those two properties are used below, so the result
--     is strictly stronger than "no reduction order": not even a bare

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- APPENDED 2026-08-19.  WHICH SŪTRA THIS MODULE IS ABOUT, AND WHICH IT IS
-- NOT -- because the corpus contains a second module about "asiddhatva"
-- that models the other one.
--
-- This file is 8.2.1 पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्: any SUBSEQUENT rule is asiddha with
-- respect to any rule that PRECEDES it, so the tripādī applies strictly in
-- the order enumerated and the later output is invisible backwards.  That
-- one-way, backwards blindness is exactly what `tripādī` implements above
-- and exactly what `asiddhaLoadBearing` shows is doing the work: without
-- it, 8.2.39 and 8.4.56 cycle k → g → k forever, and §5 proves no strict
-- order can stop them.
--
-- `NaturalMachine/AsiddhatvaBreaksFactoring.agda` proves a different and
-- also correct thing -- that a rule reading a form ERASURE has already
-- destroyed does not factor through the current form -- but attributes it
-- to 8.2.1.  That behaviour, "sees the form as it was, not as it now is",
-- is 6.4.22 असिद्धवदत्राभात्: inside the block 6.4.22-6.4.129 the rules are
-- asiddhavat with respect to EACH OTHER and apply as if simultaneously.
-- Mutual and simultaneous, not one-way and ordered.  The correction is
-- appended at that file, with sources, altering none of its lines.
--
-- THE TWO ARE THE TWO POLES OF ONE DISTINCTION, and the corpus already
-- names it in Jain terms: `Saptabhangi.क्रम-सह-भेदः` proves that krama
-- (successive) and saha (simultaneous) arpaṇa reach different positions,
-- so simultaneity is not sequential both-ness.  Read across:
--
--     8.2.1  krama   ordered, one-way blindness   buys TERMINATION (here)
--     6.4.22 saha    mutual, simultaneous         buys INFORMATION
--                                                 (AsiddhatvaBreaksFactoring)
--
-- Pāṇini spends a sūtra on each.  They are not variants of one device, and
-- reading them as one is what produced the misattribution.  The
-- correspondence is offered as a reading, not proved; the sūtra
-- identification is sourced.
