--
-- WHAT THIS SETTLES
--
-- `runtime/execute/acmatch.py` opens with a 113-line docstring headed
-- "THE SEMANTICS, STATED BEFORE THE CODE".  It permits an AC residue at
-- the ROOT of a pattern and forbids one at every INNER AC node, and it
-- gives this reason:
--
--     an inner residue would make the instantiated left side a
--     *different term* from the subject ((#0+#1) matched against a+b+c
--     with residue c claims the subject is a+b, which it is not), so an
--     inner residue is unsound for a rewrite, not merely expensive.
--
-- That reason is false, and provably so *by the module's own root
-- construction*.  At the root the instantiated base left side is also a
-- different term from the subject -- `mul ?a ?a` against `mul x y x z`
-- is not `mul x x` -- and the module repairs exactly that by building a
-- DERIVED LEMMA whose left side is the pattern EXTENDED by fresh residue
-- variables (`_ac_try` -> `derive_ac_lemma`, gates G1-G5).  The same
-- extension is available verbatim at an inner node: replace the inner
-- node `q` by `q` with the residue variables appended.  Gate G3
-- (`ac_canonical` agreement) and gate G4 (`poly_equal`) both still make
-- sense there.  So "different term from the subject" cannot be what
-- separates the two cases.
--
-- What actually separates them is UNIFORMITY of the derived RIGHT side.
-- The module's root construction is
--
--     rhs' = mk(lhs.kind, (base.rhs,) + rvars)                (sec. 4)
--
-- a function of the base RIGHT side and the residue ALONE -- it never
-- inspects `base.lhs`.  This file proves:
--
--   * `ACRoot.rootSound` / `ACRoot.rootUniform` -- at the root that
--     construction IS sound, for any associative-commutative operator,
--     any arity, any permutation, any residue; and it is uniform, i.e.
--     two base lemmas with the same right side and the same residue
--     force the same derived value.  Gates G3 and G4 are exactly the
--     two hypotheses.
--
--   * `noUniformInner` -- at an inner node NO such function exists.
--     Not "the module has not implemented one": none exists.  ONE base
--     lemma, ONE syntactically identical inner AC node occurring at two
--     positions, ONE residue, TWO correct and unequal derived right
--     sides (`ext₁-correct`, `ext₂-correct`, `7≢8`).
--
-- So the docstring forbids the right thing for the wrong reason.  The
-- correct statement of the obstruction is:
--
--     Root residue is an instance of CONGRUENCE: the derived left side
--     is C[base.lhs] for the context C = (·) ⊕ Z, so the derived right
--     side is C[base.rhs], uniformly.  Inner residue is not a
--     congruence instance at all: the derived left side is
--     base.lhs[p := q ⊕ Z], a SUBSTITUTION INTO the pattern rather than
--     a context around it.  Nothing in equational logic sends
--     base.lhs = base.rhs to a statement about base.lhs[p := q ⊕ Z],
--     and the required right side depends on how the surrounding
--     context acts on position p -- additively at one occurrence,
--     multiplicatively at another, in the single witness below.
--
-- METHOD NOTE (the draw's two lenses, which disagree here).  Poincare:
-- the AC matcher is an exponential search with no closed form, so study
-- the qualitative flow -- which is what the docstring does, and it
-- misidentifies the invariant.  Gauss: build the scaffolding, publish
-- the theorem.  The theorem is `rootUniform` + `noUniformInner`; the
-- scaffolding is the 1040-line matcher.  Per CLAUDE.md the derivable
-- statement was shorter than the machinery, and this is the derivation.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, checked with Agda 2.6.3 + cubical v0.5.
