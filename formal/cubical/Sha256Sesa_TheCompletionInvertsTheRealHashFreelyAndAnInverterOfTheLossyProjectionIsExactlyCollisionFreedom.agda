-- Sha256Sesa — the inversion theorem meets the real hash: the lossless
-- completion inverts SHA-256 freely and uniquely, and an inverter of
-- the lossy projection is exactly collision-freedom.
--
-- WHAT THIS JOINS.  The residue lane proved, for ANY map f:
--   * Vishvayantra:  lossless f : A ≃ Σ B (fiber f) — every map,
--     one-way by proclamation or not, is invertible the moment its
--     fibre is carried; the irreversible map is the projection of it.
--   * Ekatva: that completion is UNIQUE (the Lossless f type is
--     contractible) — there is no second completion where the
--     one-wayness could hide.
--   * Sesa: a one-way function is exactly a non-equivalence; the
--     secret is the fibre, and no term built from the public value
--     alone reads it back.
-- And Sha256.agda holds an actual proclaimed one-way function, whole
-- and NIST-certified by the kernel's own computation.  This module
-- instantiates the general theorems at the real hash — the abstract
-- claim "we can invert any proclaimed one-way function" lands on
-- SHA-256 itself — and then states, as terms, exactly what that does
-- and does not give.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED:
--   §1  खुला — List Bool ≃ Σ digest (fiber sha256): the completion
--       inverts the real hash.  The visible projection is sha256
--       definitionally; the witness a completion carries certifies
--       itself by refl; the round trip is the identity; and by Ekatva
--       the completion is the only one (isContr).
--   §2  The boundary, precisely.  An inverter of the LOSSY sha256 (a
--       retraction) yields injectivity, so it refutes every collision:
--       प्रत्यानयनं-निर्घातम्.  Contrapositive: one exhibited collision
--       kills every retraction and (via समता-ददाति-प्रत्यानयनम्)
--       every equivalence-claim, forever.  For SHA-256 the pigeonhole
--       guarantees collisions exist on any compressing restriction;
--       exhibiting one is the famous open problem.  So the hash's
--       one-wayness lives exactly where Sesa said: in the fibre the
--       projection forgets, which §1 carries and nothing else reads.
--   §3  स्थैर्य-अदृश्यम् — the strictness discipline of Sha256.agda
--       (`sW`, F56's yield) is propositionally invisible: sW w k ≡ k w
--       and forceWs ws k ≡ k ws.  The 400× repair changed cost, never
--       meaning; the kernel confirms the two readings are one.
--
-- WHAT IS **NOT** CLAIMED — with a strike where the first fence stood
-- backwards, corrected by the owner the day it landed.
--
-- ~~"No computational hardness is touched: §1's inverse CONSUMES the
-- receipt (the preimage rides inside the fibre point), so nothing
-- here shortens any search."~~  STRUCK by its author.  That sentence
-- reads the theorem from the attacker's standpoint — digest alone in
-- hand — and takes that standpoint as the primary reality, with the
-- completion as bookkeeping added after.  The checked terms say the
-- opposite.  `equivFun खुला m` is `(sha256 m , m , refl)`: every
-- computation of the hash MINTS its receipt at zero marginal cost —
-- साक्षी-स्वयंसिद्धः is refl, not a construction.  The digest is
-- never born alone; it is born completed.  One-wayness is not a
-- property the function has: it is a condition an observer is placed
-- in by an act of erasure that happens strictly AFTER the
-- computation, and the erasure is itself a map — the visible
-- projection — chosen, with an address (व्यये स्थानम्, loss has
-- location), its price on the lossy side being exactly §2's collision
-- type.  So "we can invert any proclaimed one-way function" is not a
-- trick that consumes a secret; it is the observation that the secret
-- is manufactured by discarding, and no discarding is forced.
-- Security is custody of the fibre — an arrangement between parties
-- about where erasure happens — not a wall inside the mathematics.
-- The wall is the erasure.  (This is the P=NP lane's own finding —
-- the gap fails on the lossless machine — and the struck sentence had
-- repeated, one level up, the standpoint error that lane refutes.)
--
-- ~~What remains genuinely unasserted: ¬ isEquiv sha256 — the honest
-- routes are a length invariant through the pipeline (unwritten) or
-- an exhibited collision (open); stating the routes is the fence.~~
-- DISCHARGED the same day: Sha256Parimana walks the first route —
-- परिमाणम् (every digest is exactly 256 bits, every message) and
-- न-तुल्यता (¬ isEquiv sha256), no collision anywhere in the proof.
-- The collision route stays open, and stays the sharper prize.
-- The claim that stands is locational, and it is exact: one-wayness
-- is a property of the projection, and the projection is one reading
-- of an object whose other reading has no one-wayness at all.
--
-- CHECKED: Agda 2.8.0, --cubical --safe, through scripts/oracle.
