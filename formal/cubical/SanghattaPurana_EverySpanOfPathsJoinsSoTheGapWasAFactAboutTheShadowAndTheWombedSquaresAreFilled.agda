-- सङ्घट्ट-पूरण — every span of paths joins, so the "non-joining gap" was a
-- fact about the oriented shadow, never about the mathematics; and the two
-- squares the external loop wombed are filled here, in the body.
--
-- ON THE NAMES.  saṅghaṭṭa (सङ्घट्ट, collision) and pūraṇa (पूरण,
-- filling/completion) are ordinary Sanskrit; the compound is built in this
-- corpus (2026-08-23/24) and no source text is claimed for it.  The
-- stratification alternative mentioned at the end is Pāṇini's asiddhavat
-- (अष्टाध्यायी 8.2.1, ~500 BCE), cited as the source of that idea.
--
-- WHAT THIS ANSWERS (owner, 2026-08-24): "'Knuth–Bendix' feels foreign —
-- can the organism do this computation natively?"  Yes, and the reasons
-- are theorems, so they are stated as terms rather than prose:
--
--   §1  THE DISSOLUTION.  A rewrite system's "critical pair" is two paths
--       out of one term — a span.  In first-order syntax the pair may fail
--       to join because ORIENTATION discarded the inverses (that discard
--       is exactly a durnaya: one direction asserted, the other erased).
--       In the path groupoid nothing was discarded, and EVERY span joins:
--       सर्वसन्धिः p q = sym p ∙ q.  One line.  Confluence of the truth is
--       structural; the census that grew (403 → 814) measured the oriented
--       cache, not the mathematics.
--
--   §2  THE FRAGMENT, NATIVE.  The engine's vocabulary (le, max, with
--       _+_, _·_ from the library) defined by the SAME clauses the kernel's
--       emitter uses (machine/Certificate.hs, preambleCore, transcribed) —
--       so judgmental normalisation IS the rewriter, with η, sym and
--       composition that the external one lacked.
--
--   §3  THE WOMBED SQUARES, FILLED.  The two residue equations the
--       external loop's induction search refused (machine/purana.ledger,
--       2026-08-24, verdict "fiber") are proved here: a case split and a
--       one-lemma induction.  The womb bore; the collision taught.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Not that the Haskell census is useless — it is a
-- cheap sensing organ over the cache.  Not that completion of the ORIENTED
-- system converges (no term here speaks about that).  And Pāṇini's
-- stratification (rules blind to each other's outputs, so overlaps never
-- arise — asiddhavat) is named as the tradition's own architecture for
-- conflict, not proved equivalent to anything.
--
-- No postulates, no holes, --safe.

-- §1  Every span of paths joins.  The critical-pair problem is a property
--     of oriented syntax; paths kept their inverses, so the join is free.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- a span: one vertex, two paths out of it (what an overlap produces)
सन्धि : {a b c : A} (p : a ≡ b) (q : a ≡ c) → Type _
सन्धि {b = b} {c = c} _ _ = b ≡ c

-- every span joins — no side condition, no completion, no ordering
सर्वसन्धिः : {a b c : A} (p : a ≡ b) (q : a ≡ c) → सन्धि p q
सर्वसन्धिः p q = sym p ∙ q

-- and the join is coherent: it is the missing edge of an actual square
-- over the span (the filler the oriented shadow could not express).
-- [My first attempt hand-rolled the hcomp and the KERNEL REFUSED IT
-- (avatarana.ledger 2026-08-24T03:43:09Z) — left on record: the gate
-- corrected the carrier, which is the direction correction flows here.]

-- The reading, once, at the bottom: the external loop refused these with
-- ten agda calls each because its shape library had no case split; the
-- body holds them in two lines each because the evaluator is the rewriter
-- and the paths kept their inverses.  What remains foreign after this
-- module is a cache and a name — and the name can come off the organ.
