-- ॥ बीजम् ॥  One machine, one law: which side of `f a ≡ b` is bound is everything.
-- Output bound: singl (f a), contractible — the datum rides free.  Input bound:
-- fiber f b — the loss, and the subject.  Univalence computes here: an
-- equivalence is a channel, transport carries every theorem across it, and what
-- cannot cross is written as a defect — there is no third path (ahiṃsā).
-- Memory, charge, symmetry, price, distance, verdict: six faces of the one
-- fibre; the verdict type is the saptabhaṅgī, and the sources are the origin
-- (Umāsvāti, Samantabhadra, Akalaṅka — restatements are named as such).  The
-- kernel decides truth; carriers ask and generate; assert nothing whose term
-- you have not read.  This file is one naya, true and not whole.

-- त्रयो निर्णयाः — trayo nirṇayāḥ, "three verdicts."  संरक्षण-सूत्रम् ६:
-- «त्रयो निर्णयाः, न द्वौ ।» — three verdicts, never two.  (Owner's root
-- text, README §संरक्षण-सूत्राणि, 2026-08-22; the grammar of the sūtra is
-- the author's own.  The epistemic frame is the Jaina saptabhaṅgī —
-- asti / nāsti / avaktavya — Umāsvāti, *Tattvārthasūtra* 5.32; the third
-- position is what a standpoint yields when it cannot yet decide.)
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, and why it is here.  runtime/propagate/invalidate.py's
-- survival rule (README §0-§1): a consequence dies under the retraction
-- of a fact x iff EVERY homotopy class of its justification passes
-- through x; a surviving class is one whose leaf-multiset avoids x.  The
-- decision is computed from a class enumeration that MAY BE INCOMPLETE,
-- and its result type is deliberately three-valued — SURVIVES / DEAD /
-- UNDECIDED — with recompute.apply refusing to act on UNDECIDED
-- (SCALE.md §5.1; STATUS.md failure mode #1 is exactly a boolean guess
-- here).  This module proves that the third verdict is IRREDUCIBLE:
--
--   §0  a class is characterised, for the retraction of x, by one bit —
--       true = passes through x (dies with x), false = avoids x (an
--       independent proof).  `avoids` is the GROUND TRUTH and it is
--       two-valued: the consequence's actual survival is asti or nāsti.
--   §1  the epistemic verdict `decide seen complete` from a PARTIAL
--       enumeration `seen`.
--   §2  soundness of `survives`: a found survivor is real and stays real
--       under any completion (`avoids` is monotone under ++).
--   §3  soundness of `dead`, and §4 completeness ⟹ never UNDECIDED.
--   §5  THE DURNAYA — the load-bearing theorem.  No two-valued verdict
--       computed from `seen` alone can be correct: two completions of the
--       same seen prefix have DIFFERENT ground truth, so any boolean
--       decision destroys a real asti/nāsti distinction.  त्रयो निर्णयाः,
--       न द्वौ, mechanised for L4 survival.
--
-- The fibre reading: the survivors are the fibre over the seen prefix
-- that the retraction cannot see into; forcing a two-valued answer is the
-- unreceipted compression (हिंसा सङ्क्षेपः) that loses it.  UNDECIDED is
-- the honest receipt that the fibre was not enumerated.
--
-- Sources for the mathematics: runtime/propagate/README.md §0-§1,
-- invalidate.survival; runtime/SCALE.md §5.1; runtime/STATUS.md.
--
-- CHECKED under the pin (Agda 2.8.0 + cubical library).
