--
-- NAMING, STATED FIRST BECAUSE CLAUDE.md's FILE-NAMING NOTE 2 REQUIRES IT.
--
-- The mathematics in this module originates with Eudoxus of Cnidus, as
-- transmitted in Euclid, *Elements* Book V, definition 4:
--
--   λόγον ἔχειν πρὸς ἄλληλα μεγέθη λέγεται, ἃ δύναται
--   πολλαπλασιαζόμενα ἀλλήλων ὑπερέχειν.
--   "Magnitudes are said to have a ratio to one another which are
--    capable, when multiplied, of exceeding one another."
--
-- The file therefore leads with the source's own term for the object,
-- λόγον ἔχειν / *logon echein*, "to have a ratio", transliterated.  Greek,
-- not Sanskrit, because Greek is the source language here.  **No Sanskrit
-- label is invented for this**, and no Indian text is claimed as its
-- origin; note 2 of the file-naming rule forbids exactly that, and the
-- section "THE OTHER DIRECTION" below runs the provenance search in the
-- other direction and reports a negative result plainly rather than
-- manufacturing a lineage.
--
-- What is claimed of Eudoxus: definition V.4 is his, it states a condition
-- on *which magnitudes are admitted*, and it is the hypothesis under which
-- Elements X.1 and the double-reduction proofs of Archimedes terminate.
-- What is NOT claimed of Eudoxus: that he stated the independence proved
-- below, that he considered ordered pairs, or that he possessed a
-- counterexample.  The counterexample is this module's, and it is a
-- standard object (the lexicographic product) put to this use here.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE TRANSMISSION, NAMED.
--
-- Archimedes' *Ἔφοδος* / *Method of Mechanical Theorems*, addressed to
-- Eratosthenes, survives in one witness.  A 10th-century Byzantine
-- parchment copy was scraped, cut, refolded and overwritten as a Greek
-- Orthodox euchologion; the overwriting scribe signs and dates the new
-- book 14 April 1229.  Johan Ludvig Heiberg identified the undertext in
-- the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre, Constantinople, in 1906, read what
-- he could with a magnifying glass and photographs, and published the
-- *Method* in 1906–1913.  The book then left the record; four pages
-- acquired forged Byzantine-style evangelist portraits at some point in
-- the 20th century.  It reappeared at Christie's New York, sold 29 October
-- 1998, and was deposited at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, where
-- multispectral and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging, 1999–2008,
-- recovered text Heiberg could not read, including the part of Method
-- prop. 14 in which Archimedes compares collections that are both
-- infinite.
--
-- The *Method*'s own preface states the division this module depends on:
-- the mechanical procedure supplies the result, and *does not demonstrate
-- it* (οὐκ ἀποδεδειγμένον); the demonstration is the separate
-- double-reduction argument.  Two stages, not one, and the second is where
-- definition V.4 is consumed.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE OTHER DIRECTION, RUN, WITH A NEGATIVE RESULT REPORTED PLAINLY.
--
-- Baudhāyana *Śulbasūtra*, c. 800 BCE.  1.9 (the square on the diagonal:
-- *dīrghacaturaśrasyākṣṇayā rajjuḥ pārśvamānī tiryagmānī ca yatpṛthagbhūte
-- kurutastadubhayaṃ karoti*) is an exact statement about areas.  2.12 gives
-- the *dvikaraṇī*, the side of the square of twice the area: *pramāṇaṃ
-- tṛtīyena vardhayet tacca caturthenātmacatustriṃśonena* — increase the
-- measure by its third, and that third by its own fourth less the
-- thirty-fourth part of that, i.e. 1 + 1/3 + 1/(3·4) − 1/(3·4·34) =
-- 577/408.  The circle-squaring rules (*caturaśrāt parimaṇḍalam*, 2.9–2.10)
-- are of the same form: a construction and a stated numerical rule.
--
-- Plainly: **the Śulbasūtras as transmitted do not state an exhaustion
-- argument.**  There is no sequence indexed by a step count, no bound on a
-- residual, and no reductio.  A one-shot rational rule with no error term
-- is not a double reduction, and reading one into it would be the
-- invented lineage note 2 forbids.  (This corpus already carries
-- `Dvikarani.agda` on 2.12 and does not claim otherwise there.)
--
-- Jyeṣṭhadeva, *Gaṇita-yukti-bhāṣā*, Malayalam, c. 1530, giving *yukti* for
-- results of Nīlakaṇṭha's *Tantrasaṅgraha* (1501).  Here the answer changes
-- and it changes on one specific point.  The *saṅkalita* derivations obtain
-- the sums of like powers with the residual explicitly identified as of
-- lower order for large index, and the *paridhi* series is given together
-- with the *antya-saṃskāra*, the end-correction, in successive refinements
-- whose comparison is itself argued.  That is an **error term with a
-- stated criterion**, which the Greek exhaustion arguments do not produce:
-- a double reduction returns equality and returns no bound on the residual
-- of the n-th inscribed figure.
--
-- Plainly, and both halves are facts: the *Yuktibhāṣā* does not run the
-- double-reduction schema and does not state definition V.4's admission
-- condition; and it does state, quantitatively, what a double reduction
-- discards.  Neither text is scored against the other here.
--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT IS CHECKED.
--
-- Definition V.4 read as a rule of a system:
--
--   R1  comparison is total (trichotomy);
--   R2  double reduction: ¬(x ⊏ y) → ¬(y ⊏ x) → x ≡ y;
--   R3  λόγον ἔχειν: for 𝟘 ⊏ x, some n ⊙ x exceeds y;
--   R4  addition is strictly monotone and cancellative;
--   R5  a least positive magnitude exists.
--
-- The lexicographically ordered pair monoid ℕ × ℕ satisfies R1, R2, R4, R5
-- and refutes R3.  Hence R3 is independent of the rest, and no ordering,
-- restriction, or precedence relation among R1, R2, R4, R5 can produce it.
--
-- The two magnitudes: Ω = (1 , 0) and ε = (0 , 1).  ε is positive and is
-- the least positive magnitude; no multiple of it reaches Ω.
--
-- Positive control, so the failure is located rather than blamed on the
-- construction: within a single level, R3 holds.
--
-- SCOPE, NARROWED BY A CHECK IN §9 AND NOT BY A CAVEAT.  Euclid's magnitudes
-- admit taking a lesser from a greater (common notion 3, used throughout
-- Book V).  §9 checks that **this witness does not**: ε ⊏ Ω, and yet no z
-- satisfies ε ⊕ z ≡ Ω.  So `logon-echein-is-independent` is independence
-- over ordered commutative *monoids*, and that is all it is.  Independence
-- over ordered abelian *groups* is not settled here; the candidate witness
-- is ℤ × ℤ lex, and cubical v0.5 carries no order on `Cubical.Data.Int`
-- (a fact `NaturalMachine/OrderedSectorBreak.agda` records independently),
-- so it is not formalized in this module.
--
-- NOT CLAIMED: that ℕ × ℕ lex is a group (§9 checks it is not), that the
-- result is new (the lexicographic value group is the standard example of a
-- rank-2 valuation, and the reason a Berkovich analytification, whose points
-- are the multiplicative seminorms into ℝ≥0, omits points a Huber adic space
-- retains), or that R2 fails anywhere here.

-- 8.  TWO CLAIMS OF MY OWN, KILLED HERE
--
-- CLAIM A, which is what I set out to prove when I opened this file:
--   "A totally ordered, cancellative magnitude system with a least
--    positive element is Archimedean — repeated addition of the least
--    positive element eventually passes any magnitude."
--
-- It is true in ℕ, which is why it is tempting.  It is false, and the two
-- terms that kill it are `ε-least-positive` (ε *is* the least positive
-- magnitude) and `logon-echein-fails` (no multiple of ε reaches Ω), which
-- hold simultaneously in the same structure.  Packaged:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

claim-A-refuted :
    ((x : Mag) → 𝟘 ⊏ x → (ε ⊏ x) ⊎ (ε ≡ x))
  × (¬ (Σ ℕ (λ n → Ω ⊏ (n ⊙ ε))))
claim-A-refuted = ε-least-positive , logon-echein-fails

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CLAIM B, which I wrote down second and believed for longer:
--   "Double reduction is what carries an exhaustion proof; the
--    Archimedean condition is bookkeeping in front of it."
--
-- Also false, and killed by the same structure: `double-reduction` is a
-- checked term here, and `logon-echein-fails` holds beside it.  Double
-- reduction returns equality whenever both strict comparisons are refuted;
-- it supplies nothing that refutes them.  In this structure the two
-- comparisons Ω ⊏ n ⊙ ε are never refuted-and-refuted, they are simply
-- never established, and the proof does not start.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

claim-B-refuted :
    ((x y : Mag) → ¬ (x ⊏ y) → ¬ (y ⊏ x) → x ≡ y)
  × (¬ (Σ ℕ (λ n → Ω ⊏ (n ⊙ ε))))
claim-B-refuted = double-reduction , logon-echein-fails

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 9.  CLAIM C, the one that cost something, killed here
--
--   "ℕ × ℕ lex is a magnitude system in Euclid's sense, so §7 refutes the
--    classification for magnitudes."
--
-- Euclid takes a lesser magnitude from a greater throughout Book V
-- (common notion 3).  This witness does not admit that operation: ε ⊏ Ω
-- is checked above, and there is no z with ε ⊕ z ≡ Ω, because ε already
-- carries an offset that addition can never remove.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

no-difference-of-ε-from-Ω : ¬ (Σ Mag (λ z → (ε ⊕ z) ≡ Ω))
no-difference-of-ε-from-Ω (z , p) = snotz (cong snd p)

-- Together with ε-⊏-Ω this is the refutation: a lesser magnitude, a
-- greater magnitude, and no difference between them.
claim-C-refuted : (ε ⊏ Ω) × (¬ (Σ Mag (λ z → (ε ⊕ z) ≡ Ω)))
claim-C-refuted = ε-⊏-Ω , no-difference-of-ε-from-Ω

-- What survives the refutation, stated as a type rather than as a caveat:
-- §7 is independence over ordered commutative monoids.  Extending it to
-- ordered abelian groups requires a witness this module does not build.
